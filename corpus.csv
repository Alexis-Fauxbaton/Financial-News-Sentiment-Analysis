""this isn't like lehman brothers subject to counterparty risk in complex derivatives during the subprime mortgage crisis,"" sara devereux, global head of the fixed income group at asset management giant vanguard, noted in a q&a friday. ""the banks in recent headlines had risk management issues with traditional assets. rapidly rising rates exposed those weaknesses. the banks were forced to become sellers, realizing losses after their bond investments were well below face value.""she suggested the likes of svb and credit suisse may still be standing today had they not lost the confidence of their clients, evidenced by massive depositor outflows from both banks in recent months. ""it was more of a 'sentiment contagion' rather than the true systemic contagion we saw during the global financial crisis. vanguard economists believe that the damage has been largely contained, thanks to the quick action of federal agencies and other banks,"" devereux said.this view was echoed by citi , which concluded that in the absence of a clear explanation for friday's moves, what we are seeing is an ""irrational market."" the slide in deutsche bank's stock price — which fell 8.6% friday — could be one example of this. the bank launched a huge restructuring effort in 2019 and has since posted 10 straight quarters of profit. shares recovered 6.2% on monday to close above 9 euros ($9.73) per share.there was some speculation that the drop could have been driven by deutsche's exposure to u.s. commercial real estate or a department of justice (doj) information request to a number of banks in relation to russian sanctions, but citi joined the chorus of market analysts concluding that these were insufficient to explain the moves. ""as we witnessed with cs, the risk is if there is a knock on impact from various media headlines on depositors psychologically, regardless of whether the initial reasoning behind this was correct or not,"" the strategists added."

""on the equity side, i think the low flows reflects uncertainty in the marketplace, particularly fears of a recession on the horizon,"" he said. much of that uncertainty can be seen in a notable pickup in money going into money market funds, traditionally a safe haven asset. flows have increased this year, but particularly in march as the banking crisis has heated up. according to refinitiv lipper, investors poured $108 billion into money market mutual funds during the week ended march 15., its fifth-largest net inflows on record dating back to 1992. q1 big winners: treasurys and international my mother is ahead of the pack. i was joking about my mother on-air a month ago. she had called to tell me she was rolling over a 1-year bank cd and was astonished they were offering her north of 4%, after years of sub-1% returns. she was asking about investing directly in treasurys. the bank tellers at her bank even offered to call when yields were going up. when my mother becomes a bond watcher, that's a yield top. that's like the shoeshine boy talking about the stock market. my mother was right. treasury etfs were the big winners in the first quarter, taking in $39 billion, about half of that in short-term treasurys.

""what social media has done is increase the importance of reputation, perhaps exponentially, and that's part of this problem i think,"" donavan added. social media gives ""more scope for damaging rumours to spread"" compared to 2008, jon danielsson, director of the systemic risk centre at the london school of economics, told cnbc in an email. ""the increased use of the internet and social media, digital banking and the like, all work to make the financial system more fragile than it otherwise would be,"" danielsson said. social media not only allows rumors to spread more easily, but also much faster. ""it's a complete gamechanger,"" jane fraser, citi ceo, said at an event hosted by the economic club of washington, d.c., last week. ""there are a couple of tweets and then this thing [the collapse of silicon valley bank] went down much faster than has happened in history,"" fraser added.regulators shuttered silicon valley bank on march 10 in what was the biggest u.s. bank collapse since the global financial crisis in 2008. while information can spread within seconds, money can now be withdrawn just as quickly. mobile banking has changed the fundamental behavior of bank users, as well as the optics of a financial collapse. ""there were no queues outside banks in the way there were with northern rock in the u.k. back in [the financial crisis] — that didn't happen this time — because you just go online and click a couple of buttons and off you go,"" paul donavan told cnbc. this combination of quick information dissemination and access to funds can make banks more vulnerable, according to stefan legge, head of tax and trade policy at the university of st. gallen's iff institute for financial studies. ""while back in the day, the view of people lining up in front of bank branches caused panic, today we have social media ... in a way, bank runs can happen much faster today,"" legge told cnbc in an email. the european union made huge efforts to shore up the zone's economic situation in the aftermath of the financial crisis, including the founding of new financial oversight institutions and implementing stress testing to try to foresee any difficult scenarios and prevent market meltdown.today banks are expected to have much more capital as a buffer, and a good metric for measuring the difference between today's financial situation and 2008 is bank leverage ratios, bob parker, senior advisor at international capital markets association, told cnbc's ""squawk box europe"" last week. ""if you actually look at the top 30 or 40 global banks … leverage is low, liquidity is high. risk in the banking system today is significantly less than it has been at any time over the last 20 or 30 years,"" parker said. the european banking authority, which was founded in 2011 in response to the financial crisis as part of the european system of financial supervision, highlighted this in a statement about the swiss authorities stepping in to help credit suisse. ""the european banking sector is resilient, with robust levels of capital and liquidity,"" the statement said.individual players can still run into difficulties however, no matter how resilient the sector is as a whole. parker described this as ""pockets of quite serious problems"" rather than issues that are ingrained across the entire industry. ""i actually don't buy the argument that we have major systemic risk building up in the banking system,"" he told cnbc. fraser made similar observations when comparing the current banking system with what happened in 2008. ""this isn't like it was last time, this is not a credit crisis,"" fraser said. ""this is a situation where it's a few banks that have some problems, and it's better to make sure we nip that in the bud.""even as banks have enhanced their capital and liquidity positions, and improved regulation and supervision, ""failures and lack of confidence"" can still occur, josé manuel campa, the chairperson of the european banking authority, said last week. ""we need to remain vigilant and not be complacent,"" campa told the european parliament during a discussion on the collapse of silicon valley bank. trust and confidence in the system is a ""fundamental law of finance,"" according to stefano ramelli, assistant professor in corporate finance at the university of st. gallen. ""the most important capital for banks is the trust of depositors and investors. if trust is lost, then anything can happen,"" ramelli said."

13@China's debt-heavy local governments look for new ways to raise cash@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/chinas-local-governments-finding-new-ways-to-raise-money-amid-debt-concerns.html@"beijing — debt-heavy local governments in china need new ways to raise money under a central regime that's made clear its priority is to reduce financial risks. local governments' direct debt exceeded 120% of revenue in 2022, s&p global ratings analysts said, noting that's more than what beijing has unofficially said was an acceptable debt level. ""the country's provinces and municipalities have relied heavily on expanded bond issuance to carry them through a covid-triggered economic slowdown and collapsed land-sale revenues,"" the s&p analysts said in a report last month. international monetary fund data show china's explicit local government debt nearly doubled over five years to the equivalent of $5.14 trillion — or 35.34 trillion yuan — last year. that doesn't include several other categories of related, rapidly growing debt such as that of ""local government financing vehicles"" (lgfv) — which allowed regional authorities to tap bank loans for infrastructure projects.in china's annual government work report released this month, an entire section was dedicated to preventing and defusing major risks — primarily in real estate and local government debt. ""we should ... prevent a build-up of new debts while working to reduce existing ones,"" the report said regarding local governments' situation. the topic didn't get such prominence in last year's report, pointed out ting lu, chief china economist at nomura. ""coupled with the conservative growth target [of around 5%], this may signal a potential shift in focus to tackling financial risks and hidden debt from local governments at some point this year, particularly in h2, after the economic recovery has largely stabilised,"" lu said. recent key speeches from chinese president xi jinping have used similar language in calling on officials to address systemic risks. new premier li qiang this month also named policies for ""preventing and defusing risks"" as one of the government's near-term priorities. xi has also emphasized tackling corruption, an issue that has been prevalent in china — including at a local level.over the last three years, covid and the real estate slump have cut into local government revenue, although it's unclear exactly to what extent. official data provide some insight. the ministry of finance said the country's spending on health climbed by nearly 18% last year to 2.25 trillion yuan, after barely growing in 2021. a budget category called local government funds saw revenue from land sales drop by 23.3% to 6.69 trillion yuan — a loss of about $288 billion. s&p and other analysts estimate land sales account for about a quarter of local governments' total revenue. in china, land is owned by the government and sold to companies for development — usage agreements last for 70 years if the project is residential. property-related revenue will likely remain under stress as homebuyer sentiment has yet to fully recover, said sherry zhao, director of international public finance, fitch ratings. she said local governments will likely turn to three other channels to boost revenue:• taxes — reduce the level of tax cuts announced during the pandemic• asset sales — generate mostly one-off income from the sale or rent of state-owned assets china's central government increased its transfers to local governments by a whopping 17.1% in 2022, and plans to boost support by another 3.6% this year with 10.06 trillion yuan in transfers, according to the ministry of finance. ""transfers to local governments accounted for about 60% of the increase in the central government deficit,"" s&p analysts said in a separate report last week.they don't expect local governments to fall back on off-balance sheet debt. ""even in fiscally weak regions, it is unlikely that governments will resume the use of hidden debt financing, e.g. through local government financing vehicles (lgfvs),"" s&p said. ""the long-term trend is clear: beijing wants to ease the country off a reliance on investment-driven growth."" but local governments still have bills and public services to pay for. historically, local governments were responsible for more than 85% of expenditure but only received about 60% of tax revenue, rhodium group said in 2021.looking for new revenue sourcesa few local governments are trying other ways to generate extra income — at the cost of fair market access for bike-sharing companies. that's according to lists of market access violations published in two reports in the last half year from china's national development and reform commission, which oversees economic planning. the bike-sharing industry exploded in china several years ago, attracting a flood of companies from tiny players to giants such as alibaba -backed hello bike and mobike, acquired by chinese food delivery giant meituan . now, some local authorities are trying to restrict industry players to a handful of bike share quotas, sold for a multi-year period. among the cases the central government addressed, china's ndrc economic planner said zhangjiajie city sold a few five-year quotas for more than 45 million yuan ($6.6 million) — more than 10 times the starting price. most of the other cases mentioned did not list the total transaction amount. another bike-sharing quota auction in may last year reportedly raised 189 million yuan in shijiazhuang, capital of hebei province near beijing. the city only disclosed the starting bids for what it called ""public resources,"" which totaled 17.3 million yuan. reports from the economic planner didn't include the shijiazhuang case, and the city did not respond to a request for comment. while alibaba-backed hello bike and local players won a bid, meituan's mobike did not, according to a city release. the two companies did not respond to requests for comment."

""while we don't know yet exactly how things will play out for financials from here, we are confident that the economic outlook has deteriorated and that the window for ongoing good/improving macro data is beginning to close,"" said morgan stanley's strategists led by graham secker. ""we are reluctant to downgrade the sector just here as we see scope for volatility to emerge on the upside as well as the downside … however, we see further uncertainty ahead and would look to reduce exposure into any material rally,"" the team added, also telling clients that ""banks will be volatile up and down – we would sell into rallies."" the report highlights that every rate hiking cycle over the past 70 years has ended in a recession or a financial crisis, with the current turmoil proving no exception. although financial crises do not always lead to recessions, the odds are unfavorable given recent events, such as tightening credit availability and a deeply inverted yield curve, according to the strategists. the gap between the 2-year and 10-year yields reached 110 basis points on the day before the silicon valley bank meltdown but now stands at just 34 basis points. according to morgan stanley, this steepening after the failure of svb financial , silvergate and signature bank in the u.s. and forced takeover of credit suisse signals an impending slowdown. on a top-down basis, morgan stanley recommended the following overweight-rated (a buy equivalent rating) stocks to navigate this environment with a defensive exposure. stocks in traditionally defensive sectors, such as health care and utilities, are being recommended by morgan stanley. they are swisscom , kpn , novo nordisk , ahold , and sse , among others. citi bank has also downgraded the european banking sector . strategists at the wall street bank said investors should focus on technology as the market faces increased tail risks due to concerns about the flow of credit at the major lenders. the banking concerns have also impacted the case for european equities outperforming their u.s. counterparts. previously, european equities were expected to outperform due to a potential u.s. economic slowdown or a fed-induced sell-off in the s & p 500. however, morgan stanley said the banking sector's problems have shifted this perspective, as the outperformance of european banks has been closely tied to the broader european market. — cnbc's michael bloom contributed reporting"
15@Deposit drain from smaller banks into financial giants like JPMorgan Chase has slowed, sources say@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/25/banking-crisis-deposit-drain-from-small-banks-into-jpm-wfc-c-slowed.html@"the dynamic has put big banks like jpmorgan and goldman sachs in the awkward position of playing multiple roles simultaneously in this crisis. big banks are advising smaller ones while participating in steps to renew confidence in the system and prop up ailing lenders like first republic, all while gaining billions of dollars in deposits and being in the position of potentially bidding on assets as they come up for sale. the broad sweep of those money flows are apparent in federal reserve data released friday, a delayed snapshot of deposits as of march 15. while large banks appeared to gain deposits at the expense of smaller ones, the filings don't capture outflows from svb because it was in the same big-bank category as the companies that gained its dollars. although inflows into one top institution have slowed to a ""trickle,"" the situation is fluid and could change if concerns about other banks arise, said one person, who declined to be identified speaking before the release of financial figures next month. jpmorgan will kick off bank earnings season on april 14. at another large lender, this one based on the west coast, inflows only slowed in recent days, according to another person with knowledge of the matter. jpmorgan, bank of america, citigroup and wells fargo representatives declined to comment for this article.the moves mirror what one newer player has seen as well, according to brex co-founder henrique dubugras. his startup, which caters to other vc-backed growth companies, has seen a surge of new deposits and accounts after the svb collapse. ""things have calmed down for sure,"" dubugras told cnbc in a phone interview. ""there's been a lot of ins and outs, but people are still putting money into the big banks."" the post-svb playbook, he said, is for startups to keep three to six months of cash at regional banks or new entrants like brex, while parking the rest at one of the four biggest players. that approach combines the service and features of smaller lenders with the perceived safety of too-big-to-fail banks for the bulk of their money, he said. ""a lot of founders opened an account at a big four bank, moved a lot of money there, and now they're remembering why they didn't do that in the first place,"" he said. the biggest banks haven't historically catered to risky startups, which was the domain of specialty lenders like svb. dubugras said that jpmorgan, the biggest u.s. bank by assets, was the largest single gainer of deposits among lenders this month, in part because vcs have flocked to the bank. that belief has been supported by anecdotal reports.for now, attention has turned to first republic, which has teetered in recent weeks and whose shares have lost 90% this month. the bank is known for its success in catering to wealthy customers on the east and west coasts. regulators and banks have already put together a remarkable series of measures to try to save the bank, mostly as a kind of firewall against another round of panic that would swallow more lenders and strain the financial system. behind the scenes, regulators believe the deposit situation at first republic has stabilized, bloomberg reported saturday. first republic has hired jpmorgan and lazard as advisors to come up with a solution, which could involve finding more capital to remain independent or a sale to a more stable bank, said people with knowledge of the matter. if those fail, there is the risk that regulators would have to seize the bank, similar to what happened to svb and signature, they said. a first republic spokesman declined comment. while the deposit flight from smaller banks has slowed, the past few weeks have exposed a glaring weakness in how some have managed their balance sheets. these companies were caught flat-footed as the fed engaged in its most aggressive rate hiking campaign in decades, leaving them with unrealized losses on bond holdings. bond prices fall as interest rates rise. it's likely other institutions will face upheaval in the coming weeks, citigroup ceo jane fraser said during an interview on wednesday. ""there could well be some smaller institutions that have similar issues in terms of their being caught without managing balance sheets as ably as others,"" fraser said. ""we certainly hope there will be fewer rather than more."""

""it's relatively frictionless,"" said christine benz, director of personal finance at morningstar. ""we're not conducting a transaction to pay for those services.""small fees can add up to thousands over timeinvestment fees are often expressed as a percentage of investors' assets, deducted annually. investors paid an average 0.40% fee for mutual and exchange-traded funds in 2021, according to morningstar. this fee is also known as an ""expense ratio."" that means the average investor with $10,000 would have had $40 withdrawn from their account last year. that dollar fee would rise or fall each year according to the investment balance. the percentage and dollar amount may seem innocuous, but even small variations in fees can add up significantly over time due to the power of compounding. in other words, in paying higher fees an investor loses not only that extra money but the growth it could have seen over decades.the bulk — 96% — of investors who responded to finra's survey noted their main motivation for investing is to make money over the long term. the securities and exchange commission has an example to demonstrate the long-term dollar impact of fees. the example assumes a $100,000 initial investment earning 4% a year for 20 years. an investor who pays a 0.25% annual fee versus one paying 1% a year would have roughly $30,000 more after two decades: $208,000 versus $179,000. that dollar sum might well represent about a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in retirement, give or take, for someone with a $1 million portfolio.fees can affect moves such as 401(k) rolloversfees can have a big financial impact on common decisions such as rolling over money from a 401(k) plan into an individual retirement account. rollovers — which might occur after retirement or a job change, for example — play a ""particularly important"" role in opening traditional, or pretax, iras, according to the investment company institute. seventy-six percent of new traditional iras were opened only with rollover dollars in 2018, according to ici, an association representing regulated funds, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and closed-end funds.about 37 million — or 28% — of u.s. households own traditional iras, holding a collective $11.8 trillion at the end of 2021, according to ici. but ira investments typically carry higher fees than those in 401(k) plans. as a result, investors would lose $45.5 billion in aggregate savings to fees over 25 years, based only on rollovers conducted in 2018, according to an analysis by the pew charitable trusts, a nonpartisan research organization.index funds are passively managed; instead of deploying stock- or bond-picking strategies, they seek to replicate the performance of a broad market index such as the s&p 500 index , a barometer of u.s. stock performance. they're typically less expensive than actively managed funds. investors paid an average 0.60% for active funds and 0.12% for index funds in 2021, according to morningstar. benz recommends 0.50% as a ""good upper threshold for fees."" it may make sense to pay more for a specialized fund or a small fund that must charge more each year due to smaller economies of scale, benz said. a higher fee — say, 1% — may also be reasonable for a financial advisor, depending on the services they provide, benz said. for 1%, which is a common fee among financial advisors, customers should expect to get services beyond investment management, such as tax management and broader financial planning. ""the good news is most advisors are indeed bundling those services together,"" she said."

""the council also discussed ongoing efforts at member agencies to monitor financial developments.""there were no other details provided on the meeting. the readout, released shortly after the market closed friday, came around the same time as new fed data showed that bank customers collectively pulled $98.4 billion from accounts for the week ended march 15. that would have covered the period when the sudden failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank rocked the industry. data show that the bulk of the money came from small banks. large institutions saw deposits increase by $67 billion, while smaller banks saw outflows of $120 billion. the withdrawals brought total deposits down to just over $17.5 trillion and represented about 0.6% of the total. deposits have been on a steady decline over the past year or so, falling $582.4 billion since february 2022, according to seasonally adjusted fed data released friday. money market funds have seen assets rise over the past two weeks, up $238 billion to $5.13 trillion, according to investment company institute data through march 22. earlier this week, powell also sought to assure the public that the banking system is safe.

""and i think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe."" powell noted that deposit flows ""have stabilized over the past week"" following what he called ""powerful actions"" from the fed to backstop the system. banks have been flocking to emergency lending facilities set up after the failures of svb and signature. data released thursday showed that institutions took a daily average of $116.1 billion of loans from the central bank's discount window, the highest since the financial crisis, and have taken out $53.7 billion from the bank term funding program."

20@Here are a financial advisor's 4 most important money tips for parents with young kids@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/24/an-advisors-4-most-important-money-tips-for-parents-with-young-kids.html@"parents with young kids or those expecting a child may wonder: what financial steps should i take to set my family up for success? here are four of the top considerations, according to rianka dorsainvil, a certified financial planner and co-ceo of 2050 wealth partners. dorsainvil is also a member of cnbc's advisor council.there are tax-advantaged ways to save for your child's future education. among the most popular is the 529 plan, which allows parents to invest money for higher education and other costs. the investment grows tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free if used for ""qualified"" expenses. qualified costs include enrollment at a college or university, books, computers, and room and board, among others. they also include up to $10,000 a year of tuition at a private k-12 school, and up to $10,000 on student loan repayments during one's lifetime.one big benefit, dorsainvil said: parents can easily change the account beneficiary later if their kid decides not to attend college. that new beneficiary can come from a host of family members. parents can also withdraw the funds for other purposes, but would owe income tax and a 10% tax penalty on the investment earnings. while each state has its own 529 plan, parents can invest in a plan outside their state. parents might miss out on a state tax break by doing so, but the most important factor when picking a plan is the investment quality, dorsainvil said. for example, parents should generally avoid funds with consistent negative returns and with an annual fee, known as an ""expense ratio,"" exceeding 0.5%, she said.parents also shouldn't save for a child's education at the expense of their own financial well-being, dorsainvil said. ""there's no loan for retirement,"" she said. ""so while it's super important for our clients to save for our children's education, we want to make sure they're putting their financial oxygen mask on first and that they're saving for their own retirement.""parents who want to invest money for their kids — and not have their funds sitting in cash at the bank — can do so in custodial brokerage accounts. for example, ugma and utma accounts are held in the name of a minor but controlled by a parent until legal adulthood. that ranges from 18 to 21 years old, depending on the state. the acronyms stand for uniform gifts to minors act and uniform transfers to minors act. one caveat: once the beneficiary reaches adulthood, the money is theirs. gifts and transfers made to these accounts can't be revoked. the beneficiary can then use the money for any purpose. ""i think parents should ask, do they want to relinquish ownership of this money when their child is an adult?"" dorsainvil said. ""that is the key question."" there are other avenues for parents to invest for their kids, but they may be more challenging. for example, parents can set up a roth individual retirement account for a minor, but the child must have earned income to do so, dorsainvil said.a common misconception is that only the rich need wills and other estate documents — but it's important for any parent to have a will, dorsainvil said. a will is a legal document that shares what you'd like to have done with your belongings and other assets in the event of your death. where this especially comes into play for parents with minor children: there's a guardianship clause in wills that answers the question of who the parent would want to have physical custody of their children should anything happen to them, dorsainvil said. if both parents pass away early and there's no living guardian, the state or court will generally decide — absent a will — what happens to the child, dorsainvil said. ""i'm pretty sure every parent knows what they want to happen to their kid if they're no longer there,"" she said."

22@Deutsche Bank is not the next Credit Suisse, analysts say as panic spreads@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/24/deutsche-bank-is-not-the-next-credit-suisse-analysts-say-as-panic-spreads.html@"deutsche bank underwent a multibillion-euro restructure in recent years aimed at reducing costs and improving profitability. the lender recorded annual net income of 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) in 2022, up 159% from the previous year. its cet1 ratio — a measure of bank solvency — came in at 13.4% at the end of 2022, while its liquidity coverage ratio was 142% and its net stable funding ratio stood at 119%. these figures would not indicate that there is any cause for concern about the bank's solvency or liquidity position. german chancellor olaf scholz told a news conference in brussels on friday that deutsche bank had ""thoroughly reorganized and modernized its business model and is a very profitable bank,"" adding that there is no basis to speculate about its future. 'just not very scary' some of the concerns around deutsche bank have centered on its u.s. commercial real estate exposures and substantial derivatives book. however, research firm autonomous, a subsidiary of alliancebernstein, on friday dismissed these concerns as both ""well known"" and ""just not very scary,"" pointing to the bank's ""robust capital and liquidity positions."" ""our underperform rating on the stock is simply driven by our view that there are more attractive equity stories elsewhere in the sector (i.e. relative value),"" autonomous strategists stuart graham and leona li said in a research note. ""we have no concerns about deutsche's viability or asset marks. to be crystal clear - deutsche is not the next credit suisse."" unlike the stricken swiss lender, they highlighted that deutsche is ""solidly profitable,"" and autonomous forecasts a return on tangible book value of 7.1% for 2023, rising to 8.5% by 2025. credit suisse's collapse boiled down to a combination of three causes, according to jpmorgan. these were a ""string of governance failures that had eroded confidence in management's abilities,"" a challenging market backdrop that hampered the bank's restructuring plan, and the market's ""fresh and intense focus on liquidity risk"" in the wake of the svb collapse. while the latter proved to be the final trigger, the wall street bank argued that the importance of the environment in which credit suisse was trying to overhaul its business model could not be understated, as illustrated by a comparison with deutsche. ""the german bank had its own share of headline pressure and governance fumbles, and in our view had a far lower quality franchise to begin with, which while significantly less levered today, still commands a relatively elevated cost base and has relied on its ficc (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading franchise for organic capital generation and credit re-rating,"" jpmorgan strategists said in a note friday.""by comparison, although credit suisse clearly has shared the struggles of running a cost and capital intensive ib [investment bank], for the longest time it still had up its sleeve both a high-quality asset and wealth management franchise, and a profitable swiss bank; all of which was well capitalised from both a rwa [risk-weighted asset] and leverage exposure standpoint."" they added that whatever the quality of the franchise, the events of recent months had proven that such institutions ""rely entirely on trust."" ""where deutsche's governance fumbles could not incrementally 'cost' the bank anything in franchise loss, credit suisse's were immediately punished with investor outflows in the wealth management division, causing what should have been seen as the bank's 'crown jewel' to themselves deepen the bank's p&l losses,"" they noted. at the time of svb's collapse, credit suisse was already in the spotlight over its liquidity position and had suffered massive outflows in the fourth quarter of 2022 that had yet to reverse.jpmorgan was unable to determine whether the unprecedented depositor outflows suffered by the swiss bank had been amassed by themselves in light of svb's failure, or had been driven by a fear of those outflows and ""lack of conviction in management's assurances."" ""indeed, if there is anything depositors might learn from the past few weeks, both in the u.s. and europe, it is just how far regulators will always go to ensure depositors are protected,"" the note said. ""be that as it may, the lesson for investors (and indeed issuers) here is clear – ultimately, confidence is key, whether derived from the market backdrop as a whole (again recalling deutsche bank's more successful re-rating), or from management's ability to provide more transparency to otherwise opaque liquidity measures."""

""in this recession add cre to coming toxic recession mix,"" hartnett said. his comments come as the fed reported strong demand for emergency lending programs it enacted earlier this month. the bank term funding program reported $53.7 billion in loans over the past month , while the discount window saw $110.2 billion. the central bank's balance sheet has grown by more than $390 billion since the btfp was implemented and the discount window expanded."

""the chinese government would make a decision in accordance with law,"" said spokesperson shu jueting in chinese, translated by cnbc. shu was speaking at the ministry's weekly press conference, hours ahead of tiktok ceo shou zi chew's testimony before a u.s. house of representatives committee. lawmakers questioned chew for more than five hours, and wanted clarity on tiktok's ability to operate independently of chinese influences on its parent. bytedance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the chinese commerce ministry's remarks.the questioning did not appear to relieve u.s. lawmakers. ""at the end of the day, it was clear from the testimony that mr. chew reports to the ceo of bytedance. bytedance controls tiktok,"" cameron kelly, visiting fellow at brookings institution, told cnbc's ""squawk box asia"" friday. kelly used to be a general counsel at the u.s. department of commerce from 2009 to 2013. kelly said the evidence that bytedance has legal control of tiktok increases u.s. lawmakers' doubts over how well the app can demonstrate its independence through restructuring. tiktok has a ""project texas"" plan to store american user data on u.s. soil — in a bid to show the company's claims that mainland chinese authorities have no access to them.""i don't think a shutdown a ban or a complete divestiture [of tiktok] is needed. but i do think you have to separate that legal control,"" said kelly, noting that could be done through a trust structure. but the commerce ministry's claim of control over a tiktok sale or spinoff indicates beijing wants to be involved. ""the chinese government's public declaration that it would block the sale of tiktok in the u.s. has little to do with protection of chinese algorithms and technology and a lot to do with giving washington a taste of its own medicine,"" daniel russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy, asia society policy institute, said in a statement. ""beijing, having heard [u.s. commerce] secretary raymond's lament that banning tiktok would infuriate voters under 35, is now double-daring congress and the administration to 'make my day,'"" russel said.the u.s. has increased restrictions on the ability of american businesses and individuals to work with chinese businesses on critical tech for high-end semiconductors. when asked about the commerce ministry's remarks thursday, tiktok's ceo said the app isn't available in mainland china and is based in los angeles. but he said the company did use some of bytedance's chinese employees' expertise on ""engineering projects.""chew also told u.s. lawmakers that china-based employees at its parent company bytedance may still have access to some u.s. data, but that new data will stop flowing once the firm completes its project texas plan. official chinese comments have previously emphasized that china-based companies should comply with local laws and regulations when operating overseas. it's not immediately clear how china's export control law, enacted in december 2020, might apply to tiktok. different types of exports are managed by different government organizations, ""each of which has a separate regulatory system,"" the eu chamber of commerce in china said in its latest position paper. it called for greater clarity on the roles of the different bodies involved with implementing the export control law.the u.s. and china have increasingly invoked national security as a reason to control tech. ""to be fair, there really are indeed genuine national security risks associated with [tiktok] — and that is one reason why a ban of the app from government phones and military phones makes sense,"" said glenn gerstell, senior advisor at center for strategic and international studies on cnbc's ""street signs asia"" friday. gerstell was general counsel of the national security agency from 2015 to 2020. ""as to the general public, i don't see the strategic value in china understanding what the dance moves of a teenager in minneapolis are. so the general public ban doesn't make sense to me,"" he said. tiktok has more than 150 million users in the u.s. — or about half of the country's population. it's unclear whether the u.s. will ultimately force bytedance to sell tiktok or prohibit use of the app in the country. the wildly popular app is already banned from federal government devices. ""we see a 3-6 month period ahead for bytedance and tiktok to work out a sale to a us tech player with a spin-off less likely and extremely complex to pull off,"" dan ives, analyst at wedbush securities, said in a note. ""if bytedance fights against this forced sale, tiktok will likely be banned in the us by late 2023."""

""it's unfortunate that the problems with some of the smaller u.s. banks in the last two or three weeks happened at the same time as this issue with credit suisse but the two are completely different and very largely unrelated,"" he said. ""the issues at credit suisse are to do with a long history of revolving doors at the top of the firm in management terms, a changing plan, and on top of a series of operational risk and control and compliance problems."" the final straw that sent the share price to an all-time low ahead of a 50 billion loan from the snb last thursday, which ultimately failed to restore market confidence in the bank, was the announcement from top investor the saudi national bank that it could not provide any more funding to credit suisse.""one never knows with a bank collapse when the moment of crisis will come, but at that point, that was the moment when investors finally threw in the towel and said enough is enough, and the actions that we saw over the weekend became pretty much inevitable,"" yallop added. what's more, swift action from federal reserve and the treasury department has largely been credited with successfully stemming any potential contagion to the u.s. financial system, which begs the question of how much of the blame for credit suisse's demise can really be apportioned to the svb collapse. by contrast, the swiss banking and regulatory system has come under fire. steven glass, managing director and analyst at pella funds management, told cnbc last week that the plunge in credit suisse's share price had been a long time coming, and that the loss of confidence of clients was actually crystalized by the bank's exposure to the greensill capital collapse in 2021. ""the problem with greensill, it was actually a huge issue, because that fund was marketed to a whole lot of [credit suisse's] high-net-worth individual clients as a very safe fund, as a way to get yield in a low-yield world, and when that blew up, a whole lot of their franchise lost money and they basically lost trust in credit suisse,"" glass told cnbc's ""capital connection."""

""if i had a eight out of 10 concern about binance from a regulatory perspective and from a national security perspective, this takes it to a 10 out of 10,"" duke university professor and former fdic chief innovation officer sultan meghji told cnbc. meghji's concerns about the laxity of binance's enforcement of kyc guidelines extend beyond china. ""i think explicitly about the national security implications of how terrorists, criminals, money launderers, cyber people in north korea, russian oligarchs, etc., could use this to get access to this infrastructure,"" he said, referring to some of the techniques described. wells fargo anti-money-laundering executive jim richards agreed that the techniques for bypassing binance's kyc controls could have implications beyond china. ""what about north korean customers, or russian customers, or iranian customers?"" richards asked. when reached for comment on the findings in this article, a binance spokesperson told cnbc: ""we have taken action against employees who may have violated our internal policies including wrongly soliciting or making recommendations that are not allowed or in line with our standards. we have strict policies requiring all users to pass kyc by providing us with their country of residence and other personal identification information."" the spokesperson added, ""binance employees are explicitly forbidden from suggesting or supporting users in circumventing their local laws and regulatory policies, and would be immediately dismissed or audited if found to have violated those policies."" cnbc also reached out to the binance employees and angels named in this article. one told cnbc to contact binance's pr team. the rest did not reply.in 2021, after china banned cryptocurrency, bloomberg reported that binance had stopped letting chinese mobile phone numbers register. the company told bloomberg it had blocked chinese ip addresses as well. but chinese customers have continued to seek ways to trade on binance, which include using instructions provided by employees and volunteers. in some cases, these instructions rely on virtual private networks, or vpns, software that can disguise the user's location and send messages through the chinese internet firewall. in may 2022, in a support channel on binance's discord server, a user asked, ""how can mainland users register now?"" a person using the handle yaya and identifying as a binance employee told them to activate their vpn and register as a taiwanese resident, then switch their nationality back to china. the employee also suggested avoiding using vpn nodes in the ""united states, singapore, and hong kong."" binance officially restricts access to certain products in those countries.user #1: how can mainland users register now?yaya.z: [how to register for mainland clients]:clients need to use a vpn that excludes ip addresses from restricted regions such as the united states, singapore, and hong kong. then use overseas email (outlook, gmail, protonmail) to register. please choose taiwan as a place of residence; then switch back to china at the authentication phase, then upload the mainland id card. there are steps that exchanges can and should take to prevent vpn use, said neel maitra, a partner at law firm wilson sonsini and a former sec senior special counsel for cryptocurrency issues. ""most best practices by exchanges also account for common evasive behaviors,"" maitra told cnbc. ""while it is true an exchange cannot necessarily prevent or effectively police all possible forms of evasion, i think most regulators would require that they police against the most common evasive forms."" binance told cnbc it had implemented ""advanced detection tools"" to root out users in ""restricted and sanctioned regions that had access to sophisticated masking tools including vpns.""in other cases, the advice does not rely on a vpn. in december 2022, a person with the handle stella, who was identified as a binance community manager in the company's online marketing materials, posted messages in a serverwide announcement channel, explaining how people could use a specialized ""vpn-free"" domain name and download an app which appears to be specifically tailored for customers in mainland china to use binance services. cnbc was provided the link to this app from an email address with a binance.com domain. a reporter was able to download the app from a location within china without a vpn, and register using a chinese phone number. the app is hosted on tencent, which offers a cloud computing service popular within china, and offers the ability to purchase crypto from other binance customers in prices denominated in chinese yuan, using the popular chinese apps wechat or alipay. it also has options to submit chinese identity documents for kyc verification. binance told cnbc it does not have a specialized version of its app for chinese customers. ""'binance does not offer a 'binance chinese android app,"" a spokesperson said. ""there is only one official binance app."" more often, employees appear to refer questions about kyc to binance angels, creating a gap between the company and potential regulatory violations, messages reviewed by cnbc show. binance has emphasized that angels ""are not representatives of binance."" ""our role is limited, and we do not speak on binance's behalf,"" an angel said in a binance blog post. but binance's chinese-language angels go through a separate training process that takes up to a year, according to a binance hiring page. they're vetted, trained and deployed across binance's telegram and discord groups, operating under the supervision of binance employees. reuters has previously reported on how binance offers their angels crypto discounts for their work. in one october 2022 exchange reviewed by cnbc, an angel advised a user who was having trouble accessing the specialized binance websites that were supposed to work within mainland china. that angel told the user to switch their vpn to a different region and try again. ""how do users in mainland china register their accounts?"" another user asked in a march 2022 message. ""register with an overseas email address,"" the same angel responded, before telling the user to pick taiwan as their residence. that volunteer offered similar guidance to other customers. in april 2022, another purported mainland china resident asked ""what could i do if proof of residence is required? can i change my place of residence?"" ""proof of registered residence is not required,"" this angel responded. in another case, a purported mainland resident worried about uploading their chinese identity documents, messages from march 2022 show. the same angel reassured the user they could claim to be in taiwan but still submit a chinese identity card, and binance wouldn't stop them. ""[binance] doesn't do business on the mainland, but it can't stop mainland users from bypassing the great firewall to play,"" the angel assured the user. angels also teach users about the exchange's offerings, best practices and the blockchain. in one question-and-answer lesson from april 2022, two binance angels showed chinese users how they could participate in launchpad, binance's ipo-like product for new crypto tokens. chinese residents are prohibited from participating in initial exchange offerings under chinese laws, including a specific ban on initial coin offerings. ""how do mainland users participate in launchpad?"" the angel leading the session asked, rhetorically. several users said it was impossible. but other participants in the q&a, including a different angel, said registering a foreign company or with foreign kyc would let mainland users sidestep binance's controls. ""congratulations to this top student,"" the session-leading angel responded to the user who answered ""overseas company"" the fastest. in comment to cnbc about the findings in this article, binance reiterated that the angels are not employees. ""binance angel program is a community ambassador program, no different than the community ambassadors that operate on other platforms like wikipedia and reddit. binance angels are not given access to binance equipment or binance internal systems, nor do they have the authority to speak for binance. binance angels are forbidden from sharing recommendations that are against our company policies or the law and would be immediately removed from the binance angel program if they were found doing so.""palau launched its digital residency program in 2022 in an effort to modernize physical identity cards, rolling out an nft-linked identity card that's available for a few hundred u.s. dollars annually. in a 2022 visit to the pacific ocean archipelago, zhao called it a ""very innovative"" effort. but palau's program also lets users around the world access binance using their palau ""residency"" to hide their country of citizenship and residency. customers openly referred to palau's program as a way to sidestep binance's country-specific controls, according to telegram and discord messages cnbc reviewed. when users asked how to access products and currencies otherwise unavailable to chinese residents, angels guided them to an october 2022 tweet from a handle that belongs to a binance client relationship manager, according to a binance customer who worked with them. that tweet, which has since been deleted, linked to a third-party mandarin youtube guide on using the palau residency to pass binance's european union kyc controls, even if the user lived outside the eu. ""passing"" allowed users to apply for binance's restricted visa debit card, which lets them turn their crypto into fiat currency for use anywhere. (visa declined to provide comment for this story.) specifically, the third-party video walks users through how to register with palau, purchase the palau id and upload the id to binance's exchange. it then shows a user how to create a placeholder mail-forwarding austrian address. then, it offers an apparently genuine bank statement from the video creator's german bank account, and explains how to modify the bank statement to include the austrian address. forging the bank statement takes nothing more than a pdf editor, according to the video's creator.in november 2022, one user who said they were in mainland china inquired about the binance card, messages from the discord server show. an angel directed them to the video, and suggested it would help them get it. in comment to cnbc, binance says it did not have any part in creating the video guide. ""that video is not a binance-owned piece of content, nor is the content creator a binance employee or even a binance angel."" the technique of using fake austrian credentials was well-known enough to be discussed in other chats in november and december 2022, although some of these chats did not make specific reference to this video. one binance employee warned an applicant not to apply for the binance debit card ""casually,"" noting, ""some users said their accounts were banned after attempts to change their addresses to unauthorized countries."" the customer reassured the binance employee that they had used austrian bank statements. similarly, in december 2022 messages on binance's chinese-language telegram group, users complained that they couldn't get a binance debit card.

29@Banks ramp up use of new Fed facility created during crisis@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/banks-ramp-up-use-of-new-fed-facility-created-in-crisis.html@federal reserve board chair jerome powell holds a news conference after the fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point following a two-day meeting of the federal open market committee (fomc) on interest rate policy in washington, march 22, 2023.american banks deepened their reliance on a new federal reserve lending program created after the collapse of silicon valley bank this month.institutions borrowed $53.7 billion from the bank term funding program as of wednesday, up sharply from $11.9 billion last week.banks are sitting on unrealized losses from bond holdings thanks to the rising interest rate environment. that issue helped lead to the implosion of svb, which was forced to sell holdings at a nearly $2 billion loss earlier this month. prices fall as rates rise, which led to the losses.the new bank funding program was introduced march 12 to alleviate similar strains on banks and other institutions; it extends one-year loans backed by treasurys or other secure assets, paying full price even if their market value is lower.another category of loans made mostly to shuttered banks to meet obligations to depositors and other expenses jumped as well. these borrowings surged to $179.8 billion from $142.8 billion last week. regulators seized silicon valley bank and signature bank this month after depositors pulled their savings. meanwhile, banks' use of the discount window, which is the traditional way they borrow from the fed, dropped this week. borrowing there dropped to $110.2 billion from $152.8 billion last week. the discount window offers market value rather than par value for the securities and provides 90-day loans as compared to the one-year term under the btfp.
30@Fed poised to approve quarter-point rate hike this week, despite market turmoil@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/17/fed-poised-to-approve-quarter-point-rate-hike-next-week-despite-market-turmoil.html@"even with turmoil in the banking industry and uncertainty ahead, the federal reserve likely will approve a quarter-percentage-point interest rate increase next week, according to market pricing and many wall street experts. rate expectations have been on a rapidly swinging pendulum over the past two weeks, varying from a half-point hike to holding the line and even at one point some talk that the fed could cut rates. jeremy siegel says fed chair powell still has the 'completely wrong approach' however, a consensus has emerged that fed chairman jerome powell and his fellow central bankers will want to signal that while they are attuned to the financial sector upheaval, it's important to continue the fight to bring down inflation. that likely will take the form of a 0.25 percentage point, or 25 basis point, increase, accompanied by assurances that there's no preset path ahead. the outlook could change depending on market behavior in the coming days, but the indication is for the fed to hike.""they have to do something, otherwise they lose credibility,"" said doug roberts, founder and chief investment strategist at channel capital research. ""they want to do 25, and the 25 sends a message. but it's really going to depend on the comments afterwards, what powell says in public. … i don't think he's going to do the 180-degree shift everybody's talking about."" markets largely agree that the fed is going to hike. as of friday afternoon, there was about a 75% chance of a quarter-point increase, according to cme group data using fed funds futures contracts as a guide. the other 25% was in the no-hike camp, anticipating that the policymakers might take a step back from the aggressive tightening campaign that began just over a year ago. goldman sachs is one of the most high-profile forecasters seeing no change in rates, as it expects central bankers in general ""to adopt a more cautious short-term stance in order to avoid worsening market fears of further banking stress.""whichever way the fed goes, it's likely to face criticism. ""this might be one of those times where there's a difference between what they should do and what i think they will do. they definitely should not tighten policy,"" said mark zandi, chief economist at moody's analytics. ""people are really on edge, and any little thing might push them over the edge, so i just don't get it. why can't you just pivot here a little and focus on financial stability?"" a rate increase would come just over a week after other regulators rolled out an emergency lending facility to halt a crisis of confidence in the banking industry. the shuttering of silicon valley bank and signature bank, along with news of instability elsewhere, rocked financial markets and set off fears of more to come. zandi, who has been forecasting no rate hike, said it's highly unusual and dangerous to see monetary policy tightening under these conditions. ""you're not going to lose your battle against inflation with a pause here. but you could lose the financial system,"" he said. ""so i just don't get the logic for tightening policy in the current environment."" still, most of wall street thinks the fed will proceed with its policy direction.in fact, bank of america said the policy moves of last sunday to backstop depositor cash and support liquidity-strapped banks allows the fed the flexibility to hike. ""the recent market turbulence stemming from distress in several regional banks certainly calls for more caution, but the robust action by policymakers to trigger systemic risk exceptions … is likely to limit fallout,"" bank of america economist michael gapen said in a client note. ""that said, events remain fluid and other stress events could materialize between now and next wednesday, leading the fed to pause its rate hike cycle."" indeed, more bank failures over the weekend could again throw policy for a loop. one important caveat to market expectations is that traders don't think any further rate hikes will hold. current pricing indicates rate cuts ahead, putting the fed's benchmark funds rate in a target range around 4% by year end. an increase wednesday would put the range between 4.75%-5%. citigroup also expects a quarter-point hike, reasoning that central banks ""will turn attention back to the inflation fight which is likely to require further increases in policy rates,"" the firm said in a note. the market, though, has not had the benefit of hearing from fed speakers since the financial tumult began, so it will be harder to gauge how officials feel about the latest events and how they fit into the policy framework. the biggest concern is that the fed's moves to arrest inflation eventually will take the economy into at least a shallow recession. zandi said a hike next week would raise those odds. ""i think more rational heads will prevail, but it is possible that they are so focused on inflation that they are willing to take their chance with the financial system,"" he said. ""i thought we could make our way through this period without a recession, but it required some reasonably good policymaking by the fed. ""if they raise rates, that qualifies as a mistake, and i would call it an egregious mistake,"" zandi added. ""the recession risks will go meaningfully higher at that point."""
31@One year after the first rate hike, the Fed stands at policy crossroads@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/16/one-year-after-the-first-rate-hike-the-fed-stands-at-policy-crossroads.html@"the federal reserve is one year down its rate-hiking path, and in some ways it's both closer and further away from its goals when it first set sail. exactly one year ago, on march 16, 2022, the federal open market committee enacted the first of what would be eight interest rate increases. the goal: to arrest a stubborn inflation wave that central bank officials spent the better part of a year dismissing as ""transitory."" doubleline's jeffrey gundlach reveals his trading strategy in this tricky market in the year since, inflation as measured by the consumer price index has come down some, from an 8.5% annual rate then to 6% now and trending lower. while that's progress, it still leaves the fed well short of its 2% goal. and it raises questions about what's ahead and what the ramifications will be as policymakers continue to grapple with a persistently high cost of living and a shocking banking crisis.""the fed will acknowledge that they were late to the game, that inflation has been more persistent than they were expecting. so they probably should have tightened sooner,"" said gus faucher, chief economist at pnc financial services group. ""that being said, given the fact the fed has tightened as aggressively as they have, the economy is still very good."" there's an argument for that point about growth. while 2022 was a lackluster year for the u.s. economy, 2023 is starting off, at least, on solid footing with a strong labor market. but recent days have shown the fed has another problem on its hands besides inflation. all of that monetary policy tightening — 4.5 percentage points in rate increases, and a $573 billion quantitative tightening balance sheet roll-off — has been tied to significant dislocations that are rippling through the banking industry now, particularly hitting smaller institutions. unless the contagion is stanched soon, the banking issue could overshadow the inflation fight.""the chapters are now only beginning to get written"" about ramifications from the past year's policy moves, said peter boockvar, chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group. ""there's a lot of collateral damage when you not just raise rates after a long period at zero, but the speed at which you're doing so creates a bull in a china shop."" ""the bull was able to skate around, not knocking anything over, until recently,"" he added. ""but now it's starting to knock things over."" rising rates have hammered banks holding otherwise secure products like treasurys, mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds.because prices fall when rates go up, the fed hikes have cut into the market value of those fixed income holdings. in the case of silicon valley bank, it was forced to sell billions on holdings at a substantial loss, contributing to a crisis of confidence that has now spread elsewhere. that leaves the fed and chairman jerome powell with a critical decision to make in six days, when the rate-setting fomc releases its post-meeting statement. does the fed follow through on its oft-stated intention to keep raising rates until it's satisfied inflation is coming down toward acceptable levels, or does it step back to assess the current financial situation before moving forward?""if you're waiting for inflation to go back to 2% and that's what's caused you to raise rates, you're making a mistake,"" said joseph lavorgna, chief economist at smbc nikko securities. ""if you're on the fed, you want to buy optionality. the easiest way to buy optionality is to just pause next week, stop qt and just wait and see how things play out."" market pricing has whipsawed violently in recent days over what to expect from the fed. as of thursday afternoon, traders had gone back to expecting a 0.25 percentage point rate increase, pricing in an 80.5% chance of a move that would take the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75%-5%, according to cme group data. with the banking industry in tumult, lavorgna thinks that would be a bad idea at a time when confidence is waning. since the rate increases started, depositors have pulled $464 billion from banks, according to fed data. that's a 2.6% decline after a massive surge in the early days of the covid pandemic, but it could accelerate as the soundness of community banks comes into question.""they corrected one policy mistake with another,"" said lavorgna, who was chief economist for the national economic council under former president donald trump. ""i don't know if it was political, but they went from one extreme to the other, neither of which is good. i wish the fed had a more honest appraisal of what they got wrong. but you typically don't get that from government."" indeed, there will be plenty to chew on when analysts and historians look back on the recent history of monetary policy. warning signals on inflation began in the spring of 2021, but the fed stuck to a belief that the increase was ""transitory"" until it was forced into action. since july 2022, the yield curve also has been sending signals, warning of a growth slowdown as shorter-term yields exceed longer duration, a situation that also has caused acute problems for banks. still, if regulators can solve the current liquidity problems and the economy can avoid a steep recession this year, the fed's missteps will have exacted only minimal damage. ""with the experience of the past year, there are legitimate criticisms of powell and the fed,"" pnc's faucher said. ""overall, they have responded appropriately, and the economy is in a good place considering where we were at this time in 2020."""

""there's a boatload of uncertainty here,"" as a result the fed will want to be cautious, he added. ""i think they're going… [to] decide not to raise interest rates at the meeting next week."" his comments follow u.s. regulators shutting down silicon valley bank on friday and taking control of its deposits in the largest u.s. banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis — and the second-largest ever. on sunday, policymakers scrambled to backstop depositors at both svb and signature bank, which was also shuttered, to stem the panic around contagion risks.while inflation remains a problem for the u.s. economy, ""it's moderating"" and moving in the right direction, said zandi. ""but it is very high. i think… more rate hikes may be in order. but at this point in time, it is much more important to focus on what's in your face — that is the potential for bigger problems in the banking system,"" he explained. zandi isn't alone in calling for a pause on rates hikes. on monday, goldman sachs said it does not expect the fed to hike rates this month. but the market is still pricing in for a 25 basis point hike next week, according to a cme group estimate.on tuesday, moody's investors service cut its view on the entire u.s. banking system from stable to negative. the rating agency noted the extraordinary actions taken to shore up impacted banks. but said other institutions with unrealized losses or uninsured depositors could still be at risk. ""i'm not in the ratings agency and don't have any comment on the ratings action, that's independent,"" said zandi. but he noted the move make sense in the context of higher interest rates, which could put pressure on the banking system. still, at the fundamental level, the economist believes the u.s. banking system is in a ""pretty good spot."" the failed institutions were unusual in that they catered to the technology sector in the case of svb and the crypto markets, in the case of signature, zandi noted.

""it typically takes six months for new rent data to be reflected in the cpi. the quirk in how housing cost data are collected contributes to overstating current inflation.""still, shelter costs accounted for more than 60% of the total cpi increase and rose at the fastest annual pace since june 1982.because of the housing expectations, fed officials have turned to ""super-core"" inflation as part of their toolkit. that entails core services inflation minus housing, a cohort that increased 0.2% in february and 3.7% from a year ago, according to cnbc calculations. the fed targets inflation at 2%.used vehicle prices, a key component when inflation first began surging in 2021, fell 2.8% in february and are now down 13.6% on a 12-month basis. new vehicles have risen 5.8% over the past year, while auto insurance has climbed 14.5%. apparel rose 0.8%, while medical care services costs decreased 0.7% for the month.the cpi measures a broad basket of goods and services and is one of several key measures the fed uses when formulating monetary policy. the report along with wednesday's producer price index will be the last inflation-related data points policymakers will see before they meet march 21-22.banking sector turmoil in recent days has kindled speculation that the central bank could signal that it soon will halt the rate hikes as officials observe the impact that a series of tightening measures have had over the past year.markets on tuesday morning were pricing a peak, or terminal, rate of about 4.95%, which implies the upcoming increase could be the last. futures pricing is volatile, though, and unexpectedly strong inflation reports this week likely would cause a repricing.either way, market sentiment has shifted.fed chairman jerome powell last week told two congressional committees that the central bank is prepared to push rates higher than expected if inflation does not come down. that set off a wave of speculation that the fed could be teeing up a 0.5 percentage point hike next week.however, the collapse of silicon valley bank and signature bank over the past several days paved the way for a more restrained view for monetary policy.""while only moderately higher than consensus, in the pre-svb crisis world this may well have pushed the fed to hike 50bp at its march meeting next week. it is a sign of how much things have changed in the very near term that 50bp is almost certainly still off the table for march,"" wrote krishna guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy for evercore isi.guha said it's still possible the fed keeps raising rates to a terminal rate in the ""high 5s"" if its efforts to restore stability in banking are successful."

""is this enough to qualify as the kind of break that would have the fed pivot? the market overall doesn't think so."" while market pricing was volatile monday, the bias was toward a fed that would continue tightening monetary policy. traders assigned an 85% probability of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate increase when the federal open market committee meets march 21-22 in washington, d.c., according to a cme group estimate. for a brief period last week, markets were expecting a 0.50-point move, following remarks from fed chair jerome powell indicating the central bank was concerned about recent hot inflation data.goldman sachs on monday said it does not expect the fed to hike rates at all this month, though there were few, if any, other wall street forecasters who shared that view. both bank of america and citigroup said they expect the fed to make the quarter-point move, likely followed by a few more. moreover, even though goldman said it figures the fed will skip a hike in march, it still is looking for quarter-point increases in may, june and july. ""we think fed officials are likely to prioritize financial stability for now, viewing it as the immediate problem and high inflation as a medium-term problem,"" goldman told clients in a note. krosby said the fed is at least likely to discuss the idea of holding off on an increase. next week's meeting is a big one in that the fomc not only will make a decision on rates but also will update its projections for the future, including its outlook for gdp, unemployment and inflation. ""undoubtedly, they're discussing it. the question is, will they be worried perhaps that that nurtures fear?"" she said. ""they should telegraph [before the meeting] to the market that they're going to pause, or that they're going to continue fighting inflation. this is all up for discussion.""citigroup economist andrew hollenhorst said pausing — a term fed officials generally dislike — now would send the wrong message to the market. the fed has sought to burnish its credentials as an inflation fighter after it spent months disavowing rising prices as nothing more than a ""transitory"" effect from the early days of the covid pandemic. powell repeatedly has said the fed will stay the course until it makes significant progress in getting inflation down to its 2% target. citi, in fact, sees the fed continuing to raise its benchmark funds rate to a target range of 5.5%-5.75%, compared to the current 4.5%-4.75% and well above the market pricing of 4.75%-5%. ""fed officials are unlikely to pivot at next week's meeting by pausing rate hikes, in our view,"" hollenhorst said in a client note. ""doing so would invite markets and the public to assume that the fed's inflation fighting resolve is only in place up to the point when there is any bumpiness in financial markets or the real economy."" bank of america said it remains ""watchful"" for any signs that the current banking crisis is spreading, a condition that could change the forecast. ""if the fed is successful at corralling the recent market volatility and ringfencing the traditional banking sector, then it should be able to continue its gradual pace of rate hikes until monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive,"" michael gapen, bofa's chief u.s. economist, told clients. ""our outlook for monetary policy is always data dependent; at present it is also dependent on stresses in financial markets."" powell also has emphasized the importance of using data to determine the direction in which he wants to steer policy. the fed will get its final look at inflation metrics this week when the labor department releases its february consumer price index on tuesday and the producer price counterpart on wednesday. a new york fed survey released monday showed that one-year inflation expectations plummeted during the month."

""while payrolls topped our expectations, the rise in the unemployment rate and relatively weak average hourly earnings data point to a little better balance between labor supply and demand.""what made the shift to 25 basis points notable was that at one point thursday the outlook for a 50 basis point move was above 70%, as gauged by the cme's fedwatch gauge of trading in federal funds futures contracts. that came following remarks from fed chairman jerome powell, who told congress this week that if inflation data didn't ease, the central bank likely would push rates faster and higher than previously expected.however, that pricing began to come in during a sharp slide in the stock market and fears that the collapse of silicon valley bank could be indicative of contagion in the financial sector. the shift towards the quarter-point probability became more pronounced friday morning, though trading was volatile and the half-point move was gaining more momentum.""the move down on 50 basis point odds was hard to separate from the collapse of svb,"" said liz ann sonders, chief investment strategist at charles schwab. ""that has to be in the thinking of fed: is this the thing that's breaking?"""

""the federal reserve has characterized the labor market as, 'oh, the labor market is so tight, employers can't find anybody,' but women went out, they looked, and some of them did get jobs, but a lot of them didn't,"" spriggs said. ""so obviously, there's a lot more workers than available jobs. and there's a lot of room left in the labor market to recover,"" he added.still, valerie wilson, director at the economic policy institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy, urged against putting too much stock into one month's report, noting that the rising labor force participation rate shows more confidence in the labor market. she attributed lower employment among black women to a slower recovery in the public sector, which employs a more significant share of black workers in education. meanwhile, leisure and hospitality continues to recover from losses during the pandemic, which boosts employment among hispanic women. wilson pointed out an upbeat finding in this latest payrolls report. ""one of the bright spots or positive things in this report in terms of women's employment is that, again, looking at industries that employ a significant number of women, we saw increased employment in those,"" said wilson, citing rises in health care, government, retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. ""so the fact that those industries are still adding jobs suggests to me that there are continuing to be additional employment opportunities for women at least as far as the demographics of those industries are concerned,"" she said."

""china now knows that if it's going to achieve its growth, it has to achieve it domestically, which means reform which is not yet undertaken, and it means getting the consumer to spend pots of excess savings, which it is very hesitant to do,"" he said.roche also noted that the ""hegemony of the u.s. is now fractured"" in the global economic order, with russia and china detaching from western democracies. he highlighted that a third fragment has formed in the ""big south,"" including countries like brazil and india, which he signaled are not overtly siding with authoritarian powers such as russia, but are also prioritizing their own interests and resisting western pressure to sever economic or military ties. in a research note last week, moody's said that the external environment will remain challenging for china, as the u.s. and other high-income countries reposition their technology investment and trade policies in light of growing geopolitical and security considerations. roche said beijing is well aware that the u.s. will look to curtail its global influence by growing the ""technology gap,"" which he expects to widen from five to 10 years at present to around 20 years. to do so, he anticipates washington could use its might to monopolize trade with countries innovating in areas of technology that are capable of serving both missiles and cellphones — such as the semiconductor industry in the netherlands. ""additional measures by western countries to restrict investment flows to china, block access to technology, restrict market access for china's firms, and promote diversification policies, could continue to weigh on foreign investors' risk perception regarding doing business in china,"" moody's said in last week's note. ""these measures also have the potential to weaken china's economic outlook.""mining stocks reacted with trepidation on monday to the chinese communist party's cautious growth outlook, given the importance of chinese operations in the sector. roche argued that ""what will disappoint in china is the way that growth is achieved,"" as infrastructure using australian or u.s. mineral imports will no longer be able to power the economy out of crises. ""i think the way that china has to go now is to mobilize its own masses to spend their money, trust the government, and not accumulate excess savings, so it will all happen in travel and in shops and in restaurants, and much less in the heavy duty stuff, which we all want to see as the motor of the world economy, because it is the motor of the chinese economy,"" he said. ""i think that model is dead as a duck."" while beijing's ambitious growth project has seemingly taken a backseat for now, leaders at the npc focused heavily on national security and on the domestic political centralization of power. the government expects the defense budget to grow by 7.2% in 2023, up from 7.1% in 2022, but strategists at bca research suggested in a note tuesday that the official figure is often an underestimation. ""the communist party is also continuing the process of subordinating state institutions to its will, which reduces the autonomy of technocrats and civil service in favor of political leadership,"" the canadian investment research firm said. ""these actions will reduce the already limited degree of checks and balances that existed between the party and the state, while signaling to the outside world that china continues to pursue centralization and national security over de-centralization and global economic integration."" negative reactions and further investment restrictions are therefore likely, at least from the u.s., bca research strategists concluded."

""he has to thread the needle here with two messages,"" said robert teeter, silvercrest asset management's head of investment policy and strategy. ""one of them is reiterating some of the comments he has made that there has been some progress on inflation."" ""the second thing is being really persistent in terms of the outlook for rates remaining high. he'll probably reiterate the message that rates are staying elevated for some time until inflation is clearly solved,"" teeter said. should he take that stance, he's likely to face some heat, first from the senate banking committee on tuesday, followed by the house financial services committee on wednesday. democratic legislators in particular have been worried that the powell fed risks dragging down the economy, and in particular those at the lower end of the wealth scale, with its determination to fight inflation.slow out of the blocksthe fed has raised its benchmark interest rate eight times over the past year, most recently a quarter percentage point increase early last month that took the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%. markets also have been torn between wanting the fed to bring down inflation and being worried that it will go overboard. the central bank's slow start in tackling the rising cost of living has intensified fears that there's virtually no way it can bring down prices without causing at least a modest recession. ""inflation is a pernicious problem. it was made worse by the fed not recognizing it in 2021,"" said komal sri-kumar, president of sri-kumar global strategies. sri-kumar thinks the fed should have attacked sooner and more aggressively — for instance, with a 1.25 percentage point hike in september 2022 when inflation as measured by the consumer price index was running at an 8.2% annual rate. instead, the fed in december began reducing the size of its rate hikes.now, he said, the fed likely will have to take its funds rate to around 6% before inflation abates, and that will cause economic damage. ""i don't believe in this no-landing scenario,"" sri-kumar said, referring to a theory that the economy will see neither a ""hard landing,"" which would be a steep recession, nor a ""soft landing,"" which would be a shallower downturn. ""yes, the economy is strong. but that doesn't mean you're going to glide by with no recession at all,"" he said. ""if you're going to have a no-landing scenario, then you're going to accept 5% inflation, and that's politically unacceptable. he has to work on bringing inflation down, and because the economy is so strong it's going to get delayed. but the more delay you have in recession, the deeper it's going to be.""for his part, powell will have to find a landing spot between the competing views on policy. a monetary policy report to congress released by the fed on friday that serves as an opener for powell's testimony repeated oft-used language that policymakers expect ""ongoing increases"" in rates. the chairman likely ""will strike a tone that is both determined and measured,"" krishna guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at evercore isi, said in a client note. powell will note the ""resilience of the real economy"" while cautioning that the inflation data has turned higher and the road to taming it ""will be lengthy and bumpy."" however, guha said that powell is unlikely to tee up a rate hike of a half-point, or 50 basis points, later this month, which some investors fear. market pricing on monday pointed to about a 31% probability for the larger move, according to cme group data. ""we think the fed hikes 50bp in march only if inflation expectations, wages, and services inflation reaccelerate dangerously higher and/or incoming data is so strong the median peak rate ends up going up 50,"" guha wrote. ""the fed cannot end a meeting further from its destination than it was before the meeting started."" interpreting the data will be tricky, though, going forward. headline inflation actually could show a precipitous decline in march as year-over-year comparisons of energy prices will be distorted because of a pop in prices around this time last year. the cleveland fed's tracker shows all-item inflation falling from 6.2% in february to 5.4% in march. however, core inflation, excluding food and energy, is projected to increase to 5.7% from 5.5%. guha said it's likely powell could guide the fed's endpoint for rate hikes — the ""terminal"" rate — up to a 5.25%-5.5% range, or about a quarter point higher than anticipated in december's economic projections from policymakers."

""the focus of tesla's cell production is currently in the united states due to the framework created by the united states inflation reduction act (ira),"" the company said on feb. 22, according to reuters. a spokesperson for the company was not available when contacted by cnbc thursday. it comes as both businesses and analysts argue that the simplicity of the ira is too attractive to pass up on.

51@The racial retirement savings gap remains wide – How these state IRA programs are working toward equity@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/28/state-ira-programs-work-toward-closing-the-racial-retirement-savings-gap.html@"the income and wealth gaps between people of color and white households are wide, but state-run retirement programs are attempting to help workers find parity. as many as 67% of private-industry workers had access to retirement plans in 2020, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. a significant number of employees, however, remain left out of these programs — and it tends to be workers of color who are missing out. indeed, about 64% of hispanic workers, 53% of black workers and 45% of asian american workers have no access to a workplace retirement plan, according to aarp. small employers are also less likely to offer retirement plans to their workers, with about 78% of those who work for companies with fewer than 10 employees lacking access to a plan, aarp found. state-facilitated individual retirement account savings programs have stepped in to attempt to close that racial savings gap.""it's preliminary at this point, but the idea was to close the retirement savings gap for people who are left out, and that tends to be lower-income workers, workers of color,"" said michael frerichs, illinois state treasurer. sixteen states have enacted new initiatives to help private-sector workers save and 11 of them have auto-ira programs, according to georgetown university's center for retirement initiatives. as of the end of january, there were more than $735 million in assets in these state-facilitated retirement savings programs, the center found. ""an important part of the purpose of the nationwide movement to have states play a supporting role for the private pension system has been this: to narrow the racial and gender and white-collar versus blue-collar savings gaps,"" said j. mark iwry, nonresident senior fellow at the brookings institution. he coauthored former president barack obama's ""auto-ira"" legislative proposal, a push to expand access to retirement savings through automatic enrollment in iras, and pioneered the nationwide state-facilitated retirement savings movement starting more than 20 years ago.rather than competing against large corporate retirement plans, state-facilitated retirement savings programs turn their focus to an underserved corner of the market: small businesses. most of these state programs require businesses to either offer a workplace retirement plan or help automatically enroll their workers into the state's program. typically, the savings program is a roth ira — which means employees are saving money on an after-tax basis — and they can put away 4% to 6% of their compensation through an automatic payroll deduction, according to craig copeland, director of wealth benefits research at the employee benefit research institute. employers themselves aren't paying for the programs, and an investment firm is managing savers' accounts. the upshot of using a roth ira to save is that the funds grow free of taxes and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement, subject to certain conditions. in the event participants need to pull money out for an emergency, they can take their own contributions — but not the earnings — tax-free. among the participants in illinois' secure choice program, about half are black or hispanic, according to frerichs. the program has been running since 2018 and recently expanded access to firms with as few as five employees.""we're getting the people who fell through the cracks and don't have a safety net,"" he said, noting that this includes employees at bars, restaurants and grocery stores. perhaps the most powerful attribute of the auto-ira plans is the automatic payroll deduction. ""this is the 'set it and forget it' mentality,"" said fiona ma, california state treasurer. it's easy for employees to spend the money that lands in their checking accounts, so having a portion of it go directly toward retirement allows their funds to grow. workers joining calsavers begin with a default contribution of 5% of their pay, and they're subject to an annual automatic escalation of 1 percentage point until they are saving 8% of their salary, according to katie selenski, executive director of the program. ""being able to save and have it accumulate has been a game changer in trying to decrease the wealth gap,"" ma added. she noted that two out of three workers eligible for the program in california are people of color. on jan. 1, the state expanded its calsavers program to businesses that have one to four employees. if they don't already offer a 401(k) plan to employees, those employers are required to have a payroll deposit savings arrangement that would allow workers to participate in calsavers by the end of 2025."

""we find no instance in which a central-[bank]induced disinflation occurred without a recession,"" said the paper, co-authored by economists stephen cecchetti, michael feroli, peter hooper and kermit schoenholtz.the paper was presented friday morning during a monetary policy forum presented by the university of chicago booth school of business. the fed has implemented a series of interest rate hikes in an effort to tame inflation that had been at its highest level in some 41 years. markets widely expect a few more hikes before the fed can pause to assess the impact the tighter policy is having on the economy. however, the paper suggests that there's probably a ways to go. ""simulations of our baseline model suggest that the fed will need to tighten policy significantly further to achieve its inflation objective by the end of 2025,"" the researchers said. ""even assuming stable inflation expectations, our analysis casts doubt on the ability of the fed to engineer a soft landing in which inflation returns to the 2 percent target by the end of 2025 without a mild recession,"" they added. the paper, however, rejects the idea of raising the 2% inflation standard. in addition, the researchers say the central bank should abandon its new policy framework adopted in september 2020. that change implemented ""average inflation targeting,"" allowing inflation to run hotter than normal in the interest of a more inclusive employment recovery. the researchers say the fed should go back to its preemptive mode where it started raising rates when unemployment fell sharply. fed governor philip jefferson released a reply to the report, saying the current situation differs from previous inflation episodes. he noted that this fed has more credibility as an inflation-fighter than some of its predecessors. ""unlike in the late 1960s and 1970s, the federal reserve is addressing the outbreak in inflation promptly and forcefully to maintain that credibility and to preserve the 'well anchored' property of long-term inflation expectations,"" jefferson said."

""it remains an open question whether momentum can remain strong in the coming quarters as firms brace against the headwinds of tighter financial conditions and sky-high energy costs, but firms have both the need and the means to further step up investment.""he added that the outlook ""appears favourable,"" if political uncertainty continues to ease — with prime minister rishi sunak's government moving away from the populism of fallen predecessors liz truss and boris johnson, while the main opposition labour party shifts to the center under ""reliable pragmatist"" keir starmer — and the u.k. avoids a bad recession. pickering also highlighted that u.k. businesses are ""lacking confidence, not opportunity,"" as the weakness in business investment cannot be attributed to concrete factors, such as difficulty financing capital spending or a lack of viable technologies that may help production processes. ""non-financial corporations are sitting on deposits equivalent to c23% of annual gdp. non-financial corporations' debt is low too. at c75% of gdp in late 2022, debt is at late-1990s levels, well below the gfc peak of 103% in 2009 and far below the current eurozone level of c145%,"" he highlighted.

58@Sanctions on Russian oil are having the 'intended effect,' IEA says@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/sanctions-on-russian-oil-are-having-the-intended-effect-iea-says.html@"bans and price caps targeting russian oil are having the ""intended effect"" despite surprisingly resilient production and exports in recent months, according to toril bosoni from the international energy agency. the european union's embargo on russian oil products came into effect on feb. 5, building on the $60 oil price cap implemented by the g-7 (group of seven) major economies on dec. 5. bosoni, who's head of the oil industry and markets division at the iea, told cnbc on wednesday that russian oil production and exports had held up ""much better than expected"" in recent months. this is because moscow has been able to reroute much of the crude that previously went to europe to new markets in asia. china, india and turkey in particular ramped up purchases to partially offset the 400,000-barrel-per-day fall in russian crude exports to europe in january, according to the iea's oil market report published wednesday. some russian oil is also still making its way to europe through the druzhba pipeline and bulgaria, both of which are exempt from eu embargo. as such, russian net oil output fell by only 160,000 barrels a day from pre-war levels in january, with 8.2 million barrels of oil shipped to markets worldwide, the iea said. the agency added that g-7 price caps may also be helping to bolster russian exports to some extent, as moscow is forced to sell its urals oil at a lower price to those countries complying with the caps, which potentially makes it more attractive than other sources of crude. despite russia's substantial export volumes, bosoni argued that this did not mean the sanctions had failed.""the price cap was put in place to allow for russian oil to continue to flow to market, but at the same time reducing russian revenues. even though russian production is coming to market, we're seeing that the revenues that russia receives from its oil and gas have really come down,"" bosoni said. ""for instance in january, export revenues for russia were about $13 billion, that's down 36% from a year ago,"" she said. ""russian fiscal receipts from the oil industry is down 48% in the year, so in that sense we can say that the price cap is having its intended effect."" she also highlighted the growing discrepancy between russian urals crude prices and international benchmark brent crude. the former averaged $49.48 per barrel in january, according to the russian finance ministry, while brent was trading above $85 a barrel on thursday. importantly, russia's 2023 budget is based on a urals price average of $70.10/bbl, so plunging fiscal revenues from oil operations year-on-year are leaving a substantial hole in public finances. bosoni also noted that the indications are that moscow may not be able to reallocate the trade of oil products in the same way as it has crude exports, which is why the iea expects exports and production to fall further in the coming months. ""we're seeing now some reallocation of trade of the products but we haven't seen the same shift as we saw for crude, which is why we're expecting russian exports to fall and production to fall,"" she said.russia announced last week that it would cut production by 500,000 barrels a day in march in response to the latest round of western bans, amounting to around 5% of its latest crude output. however, bosoni said this was in line with the iea's expectations. ""this is included in our balances that still see the markets relatively well supplied through the first half of the year, so we're not too concerned about this decline, we think there's enough supply to meet demand for the coming months,"" she said.

63@Can you bring weed on a plane? It's complicated@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/25/weed-on-planes.html@"as weed becomes legal in more states, how and if travelers can bring their stash on board remains up in the air. twenty-one states and washington, d.c., have legalized recreational use for adults 21 years and older, and 37 states and washington, d.c., have medical marijuana programs. but marijuana is still illegal under federal law. that leaves travelers hoping to fly with pot on domestic u.s. flights to face an ever-changing patchwork of conflicting state and federal laws. traveling between states where marijuana is legal in both the origin and destination may sound straight-forward, but with overlapping jurisdictions and hard-to-enforce guidelines, it gets complicated.technically, no. under federal law, the possession and sale of marijuana is illegal. despite president joe biden's recent pardons for anyone convicted of a federal crime for simple possession and his directive to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a schedule i substance. according to the drug enforcement administration, schedule i substances have no accepted medical use and have a high potential for abuse. that also includes drugs like heroin and lsd. and even though airports are locally owned and operated, air travel still falls under federal law. ""most people are under the impression that it is acceptable to travel with cannabis since it is legal in california, however, they are not aware of the travel restrictions,"" said karla rodriguez, police captain at los angeles world airports, which operates los angeles international airport. ""additionally, passengers need to be aware of the legality of cannabis in other states or countries."" she said most arrests involve ""passengers who take an amount which is more than what is considered personal use.""well, that changes things. the transportation security administration said that medical marijuana products that ""contain no more than 0.3 percent thc on a dry weight basis or that are approved by fda,"" are permitted in both carry-on bags and checked bags. tsa agents wouldn't likely ask to see a medical marijuana card unless the traveler was carrying a larger amount or was traveling through a jurisdiction where weed was entirely illegal, an agency spokesperson said.ok sure, but will tsa search me?tsa said it is not actively searching for marijuana but rather focuses screening procedures on ""potential threats to aviation and passengers"" like weapons and explosives. ""the tsa is looking for anything illegal, but they are not law enforcement,"" said william kroger, a defense attorney who's represented clients arrested for marijuana at airports. kroger says if agents find marijuana in a passenger's luggage, the tsa doesn't have the power to arrest travelers. it can, however, call local police. some local police officials told cnbc they would follow local laws in that situation. the dea could be alerted by local law enforcement if the quantity of marijuana exceeds personal use or officers have reason to be suspicious that the traveler intends to sell marijuana.what if the tsa finds marijuana on me?while the tsa isn't actively searching for marijuana or other federally illicit drugs, if it does find an amount that exceeds local limits, which vary widely for both weed and thc-infused edibles, it will alert local officials. some airports offer amnesty boxes for travelers to discard their pot before traveling. there are 12 at chicago's o'hare international airport and one at midway international airport, according to the chicago department of aviation. cannabis products are legal for personal use in illinois as of jan. 1, 2020, and residents can possess up to 30 grams, or about an ounce, of cannabis flower.""when the amnesty boxes are cleared and there are items in the box, officers will create a report, inventory the cannabis or cannabis products and then they will be disposed of similar to how narcotics are disposed of,"" a spokesperson for the chicago police department said in a statement. in new york and new jersey, airport police enforce those states' laws, said a spokesperson for the port authority of new york and new jersey, which oversees the area's largest airports. new york and new jersey each legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2021. travelers at denver international airport can return their marijuana to their vehicle or pass it to someone not traveling if it's no more than 2 ounces, according to the denver police department. colorado legalized recreational pot back in 2014. they can also surrender it to police officers where it will be ""sent to get destroyed and not returned to them,"" said jay casillas at the denver police department. ""any amounts greater than 2 ounces will warrant an investigation where they may be subject to arrest and may face charges."" however, the severity of the penalty is largely up to the jurisdiction, said kroger, the defense attorney. in states with harsher marijuana laws, ""you could be facing serious time in jail or prison,"" he said.airlines' contracts of carriage, the document that lists policies for everything from overbooked flights to lost baggage, state that intoxicated travelers can't fly. in a practice that's similar to how a passenger trying to board barefoot will be denied boarding, airlines can refuse to allow a customer to get on the plane if, according to delta's rules, for example, ""the passenger's conduct is disorderly, abusive or violent, or the passenger appears to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.""again, no. marijuana rules vary across the world, but it is still banned outright in many countries, and while many of the high-profile prison sentences for carrying weed through foreign countries are for large quantities, even smaller amounts could carry hefty fines or more severe punishments."
64@Shrinking food stamp benefits for families mean yet another challenge for retailers@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/26/shrinking-food-stamp-benefits-retailers.html@"for some shoppers who already struggle to cover grocery bills, the budget is getting tighter. this month, pandemic-related emergency funding from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, formerly known as food stamps, is ending in most states, leaving many low-income families with less to spend on food. more than 41 million americans receive funding for food through the federal program. for those households, it will amount to at least $95 less per month to spend on groceries. yet for many families, the drop will be even steeper since the government assistance scales up to adjust for household size and income. for grocers like kroger , big-box players like walmart and discounters like dollar general , the drop in snap dollars adds to an already long list of worries about the year ahead. it's likely to pressure a weakening part of retailers' business: sales of discretionary merchandise, which are crucial categories for retailers, as they tend to drive higher profits. major companies, including best buy , macy's and target , have shared cautious outlooks for the year, saying shoppers across incomes have become more careful about spending on items such as clothing or consumer electronics as they pay more for necessities such as housing and food. food, in particular, has emerged as one of the hardest-hit inflation categories, up 10.2% year-over-year as of february, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. ""you still have to feed the same number of mouths, but you have to make choices,"" said karen short, a retail analyst for credit suisse. ""so what you're doing is you're definitely having to cut back on discretionary,"" she said. the stretch has made it impossible for some to afford even basic items. it's still too early to see the full impact of the reduced snap benefits, said north texas food bank ceo trisha cunningham, but food pantries in the dallas-fort worth area have started to see more first-time guests. the nonprofit helps stock shelves at pantries that serve 13 counties. demand for meals has ballooned, even from pandemic levels, she said. the nonprofit used to provide about 7 million meals per month before the pandemic and now provides between 11 million and 12 millions meals per month. ""we knew these [extra snap funds] were going away and they were going to be sunsetted,"" she said. ""but what we didn't know is that we were going to have the impact of inflation to deal with on top of this.""so far, retail sales in the first two months of the year have proven resilient, even as consumers contend with inflation and follow a stimulus-fueled boom in spending in the early years of the pandemic. on a year-over-year basis, retail spending was up 17.6% in february, according to the commerce department. some of those higher sales have come from higher prices. the annual inflation rate is at 6% as of february, according to the labor department's tracking of the consumer price index, which measures a broad mix of goods and services. that index has also gotten a lift from restaurant and bar spending, which has bounced back from earlier in the pandemic and begun to compete more with money spent on goods. yet retailers themselves have pointed out cracks in consumer health, noting rising credit card balances, more sales of lower-priced private label brands and shoppers' heightened response to discounts and promotions. some retailers mentioned the snap funding decrease on earnings calls, too. kroger ceo rodney mcmullen called it ""a meaningful headwind for the balance of the year."" ""we're hopeful that everybody will work together to continue or find additional money,"" he said on the company's earnings call with investors earlier this month. ""but as you know, because of inflation, there's a lot of people whose budget is under strain."" credit suisse's short said for lower-income families, the food cost squeeze comes on top of climbing expenses for nearly everything else, whether that's paying the electric bill or filling up the gas tank. ""i don't think i could tell you what a tailwind is for the consumer,"" she said. ""there just isn't a single tailwind in my view."" emergency allotments of snap benefits previously ended in 18 states, which could preview the effect of the decreased funding nationwide. in a research note for credit suisse, short found an average decline in snap spending of 28% across several retailers from the date the additional funding ended. some grocers and big-box retailers could feel the impact more than others. according to an analysis by credit suisse, grocery outlet has the highest exposure to snap with an estimated 13% of its 2021 sales coming from the program. that's followed by bj's wholesale with about 9%, dollar general at about 9%, dollar tree at about 7%, walmart's u.s. business with 5.5% and kroger with about 5%, according to the bank's estimates, which were based on company filings and government data. retailers that draw a higher-income customer base, such as target and costco , should feel comparatively less effect, short said. if nothing else, the dwindling snap dollars could shift shoppers from one retailer to another, she said, as major players seek to grab up market share and undercut on prices.fewer dollars to go aroundanother factor could make for a bumpier start to retailers' fiscal year, which typically kicks off in late january or early february: tax refunds are trending smaller this year. the average refund amount was $2,972, down 11% from an average payment of $3,352 as of the same point in last year's filing season, according to irs data as of the week of march 10. that average payout could still change over time, though, as the irs continues to process millions of americans' returns ahead of the mid-april deadline. dollar general chief financial officer john garratt said on an earnings call this month that the discounter is monitoring how its shoppers respond to the winding down of emergency snap benefits and lower tax refunds. he said stores did not see a change in sales patterns when emergency snap funds previously ended in some states, but he added that ""the customer is in a different place now."" tax refunds can act as a cash infusion for retailers, as some people spring for big-ticket items like a pair of brand-name sneakers or a sleek new tv, said marshal cohen, chief industry advisor for the npd group, a market research company. this year, though, even if people get their regular refund, they may use it to pay bills or whittle down debt, he said. one bright spot for retailers could be an 8.7% cost-of-living increase in social security payments. starting in january, recipients received on average $140 more per month. however, cohen said, the cash influx might not be enough to offset pressure on younger consumers, particularly those between ages 18 and 24, who have just started jobs and face milestone expenses like signing a lease or buying a car. ""everything's costing them so much more for the early, big spends of their consumer career,"" he said."

66@The digital media rollup dream is dead for the moment — now it's all about core brand strength@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/26/digital-media-core-brand-strength.html@"when a marriage or an engagement fails, it's common for the participants to take time to work on themselves. that's where the digital media industry finds itself today. after years of focusing on consolidating to better compete with google and facebook for digital advertising dollars, many of the most well-known digital media companies have abandoned consolidation efforts to concentrate on differentiation. ""what you're finding is companies are trying to find a non-substitutable core,"" said jonathan miller, the ceo of integrated media, which specializes in digital media investments. ""the era of trying to put these companies together is over, and i don't think it's coming back."" a 90% decline in buzzfeed shares since the company went public in 2021, a failed sales process from vice, the collapse of special purpose acquisition companies, and a choppy advertising market have made digital media executives rethink their companies' futures. for the moment, executives have decided that more concentrated investment is better than attempts to gain scale. ""right now, everyone's trying to get through a tougher market by focusing on their strengths,"" buzzfeed ceo jonah peretti said in an interview with cnbc. ""we're in this period now where we should just focus on innovating for the future and building more efficient, stronger, better companies."" what's happening in the digital media space echoes trends from the biggest media companies, including netflix , disney and warner bros. discovery . after losing nearly half their market values, or more, in 2022, those companies have emphasized what makes them different, whether it be distribution, brand or quality of programming, after years of global expansion and mega-mergers. disney ceo bob iger said the word ""brand"" more than 25 times at a morgan stanley media conference this month. ""i think brands matter,"" iger said. ""the more choice people have, the more important brands become because of what they convey to consumers."" making strategic decisions based on consumer demand rather than investor pressure is a pivot for the industry, said bryan goldberg, ceo of bustle digital group, which has acquired and developed a number of brands and sites aimed at women, including nylon, scary mommy, romper and elite daily. ""too many of the mergers were driven by investor needs as opposed to consumer needs,"" goldberg said in an interview.from late 2018 to early 2022, the digital media industry had a shared goal. pushed by venture capitalist and private equity investors who had made sizeable investments in the industry during the 2010s, companies such as buzzfeed, vice, vox media, group nine, and bustle digital group, or bdg, were talking to each other, in various combinations, about merging to gain scale. ""if buzzfeed and five of the other biggest companies were combined into a bigger digital media company, you would probably be able to get paid more money,"" peretti told the new york times in november 2018, kicking off a multiyear effort to consolidate. the rationale was twofold. first, digital media companies needed more scale to compete with facebook and google for digital advertising dollars. adding sites and brands under one corporate umbrella would boost overall eyeballs for advertisers. cost-cutting from m&a synergies was an added benefit for investors. second, longtime shareholders wanted to exit their investments. large legacy media companies such as disney and comcast 's nbcuniversal invested hundreds of millions in digital media in the early and mid-2010s. disney invested more than $400 million in vice. nbcuniversal put a similar amount into buzzfeed. by the end of the decade, after seeing the value of those investments fall, legacy media companies made it clear to digital media executives that they weren't interested in being acquirers.consolidation was always a flawed strategy because digital media could never become big enough to compete with facebook and google, said integrated media's miller. ""you have to have sufficient amount of scale to matter, but that's not a winning formula by itself,"" miller said. vice's deal for refinery29 is a prime example of a deal motivated by scale that lacked consumer rationale, said bdg's goldberg. ""the digital media rollup has proven successful only when assets are thoughtfully combined with an eye toward consumers,"" goldberg said. ""in what world did vice and refinery29 make sense in combination?"" vice is engaged in sale talks with a number of buyers that fall outside the digital media landscape, cnbc previously reported. it's also considering selling itself in pieces if there's more interest in parts of the company, such as its tv production assets and its ad agency, virtue. vice is a cautionary tale of what happens to a digital media company when its brand loses luster, miller said. valued at $5.7 billion in 2017, vice is now considering selling itself for around $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the sale discussions are private. ""in the old days of media, with tv networks, if you were down, you could revive yourself with a hit,"" said miller. ""in the internet age, everything is so easily substitutable. if vice goes down, the audience just moves on to something else."" companies such as buzzfeed, vox media and bdg are now trying to find an enduring relevancy amid a myriad of information and entertainment options. buzzfeed has chosen to lean in to artificial intelligence, touting new ai-generated quizzes and other content that fuses the work of staff writers with ai databases. bdg has chosen to primarily target female audiences across lifestyle categories. vox media has focused on journalism and information across a number of different verticals. that's a strategy that hasn't really changed even as the market has turned against digital media, allowing vox media ceo jim bankoff the opportunity to continue to hunt for deals. just don't expect the partners to be vice, bdg or buzzfeed. ""we want to be the leading modern media company with the strongest portfolio of brands that serve their audiences on modern platforms — websites, podcasts, streaming services — while building franchises through multiple revenue streams,"" bankoff said. ""there's no doubt m&a is part of our playbook, and we expect it will continue to be in the future.""while executives may be making strategy decisions with a sharper eye toward the consumer, the problem of finding an exit for investors remains. differentiation may open up the pool of potential buyers beyond the media industry. buzzfeed's emphasis on artificial intelligence could attract interest from technology platforms, for instance. it's also possible that there will be an eventual second wave of peer-to-peer mergers. while integrated media's miller doesn't expect a future industry rollup, buzzfeed's peretti hasn't closed the door on the concept if market conditions improve. as executives invest in fewer ideas and verticals, the end result could be healthier companies that are more attractive merger partners, he said. ""if everyone invests in what they're best at, if you put them back together, you'd have that diversified digital media company with real scale,"" peretti said. ""that helps drive commerce for all parts of a unified company. i think it's still possible."" disclosure: comcast's nbcuniversal is the parent company of cnbc."

""trucking comes with its ups and downs, but you can overcome each challenge because we have women pioneers that were out there before us that have paved the way,"" johnson said. ""you have that support route there to help you navigate through this male-populated industry, and it offers freedom and travel."" johnson said during her time in trucking she's found her male counterparts to go above and beyond to help her navigate the industry. the wages have also been a plus compared with her teaching salary, she said. efforts to introduce more women to trucking became even more pressing when the covid pandemic took hold in the u.s., sending the service and education industries into upheaval. comparatively, trucking never slowed down. many teachers and service workers made the switch to trucking, along with nurses and other women from the medical field who faced burnout. now, with the industry facing a daunting driver shortage, initiatives to bring in women drivers from other industries have escalated. unions including the international brotherhood of teamsters have worked to end violence and harassment of women on the job and remove barriers to women entering the industry, including safety risks, wage inequities and lack of training and support.the share of women truckers has increased significantly in recent years: women now make up almost 8% of truck drivers and sales delivery drivers, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. that number is even higher — 14% — for class a license road drivers (which includes any driver who can operate vehicles weighing over 26,000 pounds), almost double what it was just five years ago, according to the 2022 women in trucking index. women also account for a third of c-suite executives in transportation, compared with nearly 24% in executive positions four years earlier, according to the index. ellen voie, ceo of wit, said women often make for quality candidates as truckers because they're less likely than men to take risks on the road, and they possess strong multi-tasking, communication and organizational skills. according to the american transportation research institute, male commercial drivers are 20% more likely to be involved in a crash in areas such as traversing intersections. ""more and more women are going into safety roles, like director safety or safety manager, and that's a great place for women because women are more risk averse, whether it's in the boardroom or whether it's as a driver,"" voie said.though many women joined the industry during the pandemic, covid-19 lockdowns stalled training and testing for truck drivers. supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, along with surging demand, exacerbated a years-long trucker shortage. the american trucking associations reported a shortage of 80,000 drivers in 2021 and has cautioned the shortfall could reach 160,000 by 2030. to address demand, the industry would have to recruit a million new drivers over the next decade, according to the ata — although as of 2021, there were just under 2.1 million people employed as heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers, according to the bureau of labor statistics. a bls report found annual turnover rates at large truckload carriers averaged 94% between 1995 and 2017. demand for product and driver numbers appear to be improving this year, said mike kucharski, vice president of illinois-based j.k.c. trucking. volume volatility remains a major problem — leaving the industry in flux with regard to hiring. ""the american people are changing their diet, they can't afford things as they used to, so with those things happening, the typical budget and volumes are coming down,"" said kucharski. ""we're kind of all fighting for the same product, and we're not as busy as we used to be due to inflation."" many truckers are paid only for driving time and are not compensated for overtime or time spent waiting for loading and unloading goods, adding to uncertainty for workers. many also pay their own fuel costs and lack health care benefits.angelique temple, who has been in the trucking industry for 23 years, spent two decades pulling hazmat as a company driver, during which time she raised six kids. she switched gears in 2021 to become the owner-operator of her own company tornado transport, although she almost lost her business, as she was paying $5,000 a week just for fuel. temple said she now drives routes of under 200 miles and works with local brokers to help ease ""rollercoaster"" price fluctuations. she runs medical supplies, dry food and other essential products while setting her own prices. it's not so much a driver shortage, she said, as it is a shortage of qualified professionals. ""you don't have a lot of people out there that have the dedication and loyalty that it takes to do what needs to be done,"" temple said. ""they don't want to sacrifice. they just want to run and come back and make their money.""women rev up for the industryaccording to a february survey by insurance agency jw surety bonds, 83% of female truckers believed more young people should get into trucking. the survey of 386 truck drivers — 60% of whom were female — found female truckers were 18% less likely than male truckers to feel lonely on the job and 28% less likely to regret becoming a truck driver. ""there are tiktok videos [where] a lot of women were excited to work independently, their schedules tended to be more flexible, and they're seeing great pay,"" said maddie weirman, reactive data lead at marketing agency fractl, who led the research. ""women are starting to see that there are opportunities for them."" about 56% of female truckers made between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, while 41% made under $50,000, according to jw surety bonds. driver software company tenstreet found earlier this year that women were more likely than men to say they were paid fairly for their work at 58.5%, compared to 55.3% for men.women were also more likely to be newer to professional driving and have driven for fewer carriers, yet women were more likely to report a good relationship with their dispatcher, according to the tenstreet data. brad fulton, director of research and analytics at tenstreet, said many women have been entering the industry ""on the ground floor"" with hopes of shaping it to be more equal and accommodating. ""as women are getting more experience, they're starting to realize some of the stresses,"" fulton said, adding that he expects the industry to start focusing more on work-life balance so workers are not ""driving themselves into the ground.""regan morton, a transgender woman in indiana who helps lead wit's lgbtq task force, said the industry has made her feel welcome. but she believes companies should better target potential drivers from the lgbtq community. ""the trucking industry, as far as the lgbtq community, allows you to be able to be yourself throughout the day and not have to constantly deal with other people,"" said morton, who is a teamsters member. morton, whose father was a truck driver, said health care coverage is often a hurdle, especially for lgbtq drivers. she said increasingly strict health regulations have made it difficult for drivers with conditions like diabetes to even enter the industry, adding that the long days make it hard to get home for doctor appointments. some common insurance plans for drivers do not cover all health care needs throughout the gender transition process, she said. despite these challenges, voie said she sees more women-owned trucking businesses, as well as more women taking over their families' trucking companies. wit partnered with expediter services to help establish 150 women-owned businesses in transportation, including financing women drivers' first trucks. cari baylor, president of her family's eight-decade business, baylor trucking, called her family's story a ""steven spielberg, tom hanks kind of american dream story,"" growing from one truck to over 200. baylor trucking once ""saved thanksgiving in canada,"" she said, after delivering ocean spray cranberry sauce shipments. the company also works with expedited shippers to delivery ivf kits, chemotherapy treatments and even taylor swift and ncaa merch. she said the industry has made strides in being more inclusive through improvements like automatic transmissions for all body types, more flexible work weeks and advanced technology equipped with everything from video capabilities to radar. the industry still has a ways to go with regard to installing better amenities at rest areas and adding safer truck parking, baylor said, though she noted the benefits of introducing more women into trucking are wide-reading. ""the trucking industry learned a lesson during the pandemic that we have to be more adaptive to healthier lifestyles for professional drivers regardless of sex,"" baylor said. ""i want young women and those graduating from college to realize that they have so many opportunities beyond the professional driving role in the transportation industry."""

""it's really a function of this hole in new production, creating a dynamic where wholesale or general used values are higher because there are millions of fewer new vehicles that would eventually turn into used."""
69@Secondhand resale is getting cutthroat as platforms such as Depop and Poshmark boom@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/24/depop-poshmark-secondhand-resale-cutthroat.html@"six months after launching his secondhand clothing shop on digital marketplace depop in 2020, blake robertson, a 15-year-old high schooler at the time, received a death threat from a customer. it came via instagram, from someone who had not received her purchase in time for christmas. ""nothing happened, but i don't know, it just opened my eyes to the fact that some people, they just really want their items,"" said robertson. demand for secondhand resale online has been booming since the early days of the pandemic, generating a culture shift within the indie marketplaces where it began. customers, many of whom have been feeling the squeeze of inflation, are fiending for lower prices, leading to more heated negotiations and occasionally ruthless bidding wars. meanwhile, independent resellers are turning their onetime hobby into a job, sometimes even upselling items to take advantage of demand spikes. users on platforms such as depop and poshmark set up online shops to list vintage, secondhand or unique items for sale and generate notable followings of loyal shoppers. robertson is now 17 and says the growth of resale has allowed him to turn his depop shop, which now has more than 19,000 followers, into a part-time gig. he told cnbc he juggles the hustle of reselling with his high school studies.he's become accustomed to the occasional hate message or dayslong negotiations over a single item. more than anything, he has been pleasantly surprised by the growing reach of his shop, which used to just serve his friends as patrons. ""i get these messages from total and complete strangers, which just makes me think how much this app genuinely has grown,"" robertson said.to be sure, death threats against resellers are not the norm. beaux abington, 49, says that overall, she's had ""really fantastic, phenomenal customers."" but she's also noticed more buyers hunting deals and has felt insulted by recent offers for her products that are sometimes less than half her asking price. ""there's definitely a price-consciousness that wasn't always there,"" said abington. about 53% of people polled in an october 2022 depop survey of more than 2,000 u.k. consumers said that they have been turning to secondhand shopping more in order to save money as living costs rise. the result, sellers say, is more frequent negotiations and intensified bidding wars. ""there's a lot more negotiation happening. even in the last year, i'd say it's kind of skyrocketed for me,"" said josefina munroe, 27, a depop seller with more than 30,000 followers. she started her shop five years ago and decided to make it a full-time job after she graduated college in 2020 and demand for online resale expanded. then there are the de facto bidding wars. munroe recalls purchasing an item on depop only to have the seller cancel her order after realizing that another customer was willing to pay more. other depop shoppers say that is not an uncommon experience. ""it's completely separate from real-world shopping because that would never happen in a store,"" said munroe. ""i think people have gotten very comfortable with the whole back-and-forth.""platforms such as depop and poshmark are leaning into the competitive consumer zeitgeist. last january, depop launched a new ""make offer"" option — a feature that has streamlined the negotiation process, which used to take place informally via direct messages. resellers say that the new button has made customers more comfortable haggling. ""the offer feature on depop has definitely created a new dynamic in terms of being hounded with low-ballers and also being expected to sell things cheaply,"" said pascale davies, 28, who runs a depop shop with 59,000 followers. but depop has yet to institute a formal function for bidding battles — like the original online reseller, ebay , offers. depop also shut down comment sections on product pages where customers used to ask questions and sometimes get in arguments, according to users. ""we found that comments on an item did not directly help buyers with their decision-making,"" a depop spokesperson told cnbc when asked about the change.in september, poshmark launched ""posh shows,"" which allows sellers to hold livestreamed auctions to sell and promote their inventory. stephanie dionne, 44, who has been selling on poshmark for about two years, said the live shows are ""all kinds of crazy and chaotic,"" generating a fast-paced, ruthless selling environment. ""when it comes to the live shows, people will kind of steal it out from under you at the last second,"" she said. since she launched her secondhand market with her two sisters, dionne's business keeps getting bigger and bigger — so much so that one of her sisters reduced her full-time day job to part-time in order to focus on the poshmark shop. last year, the dionnes made between $4,000 and $5,000 in profit. just a couple months into this year, they have already surpassed that. but now, sellers such as the dionnes are not only competing with poshmark and depop peers but also major retailers such as target and h&m that are trying to cash in on the resale boom. last week, h&m announced its most recent collaboration with the online thrift store thredup , which will now cross-list about 30,000 pieces of secondhand clothing on h&m's website. target has launched several thredup partnerships of its own, and etsy bought depop in 2021. in january, poshmark was acquired by south korean web giant naver. but some independent resellers doubt that the unique, curated experience of indie resale can be scaled. ""although bigger companies are trying to occupy this space, i think they miss the mark when it comes to the personal element of vintage,"" finn thomas, a london-based depop seller, told cnbc. ""part of the charm of buying vintage is the one-on-one interaction between the buyer and seller, the unique story behind each piece and the general curation behind a store, something i can't see the larger companies like h&m achieving,"" thomas added."

""i paid $85 million without a hesitation because there's only one of them,"" glaser said. ""you watch art, they sell. there's a mercedes 300 slr that just sold for $142 million. ... that's what this is ... it's a one of one.""when glaser bought tarpon isle, it held a modest 1940s house and plenty of potential. ""i came over the bridge, i saw the two trees and i said, 'guys, let's knock down the garage and the guest house and the maid's quarters and let's build a brand new house,'"" glaser said. the new main house is over 9,000 square feet. with the guest house, tennis pavilion and other structures, the property now has over 21,000 feet of living space. there are 11 bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms and seven half-baths.unlike many palm beach mansions, which are mediterranean-styled giants festooned with gold carvings and mahogany, tarpon isle is a study in modern simplicity, where the star of the home is sweeping water views on all four sides. the master bedroom suite is a large complex of closets, bathrooms and sitting areas. the larger of two bathrooms is a temple of white italian marble, covering the floors, countertops, ceiling and oversized shower. a large soaking tub perched in front of the windows overlooks the intracoastal waterway.""it's the best bathroom i ever did,"" glaser said. ""my wife picked it, and she did an incredible job. i've never seen anything like this bathroom."" outside, there's a new 98-foot pool overlooking the views of the water to the south. a large dock can fit multiple boats or a mega-yacht. the guest house features resort-like amenities, including a spa, massage room, salon and entertainment area. ""that's the way we designed it,"" glaser said. ""when people come to palm beach they bring their families, they're on vacation.""glaser said the human-made island, which was built in the 1940s, has a high sea wall. because it's well protected in the intracoastal and well elevated, it has easily weathered big storms and tidal surges, he said. granted, $218 million is an ambitious price, even for palm beach. the record sale in the enclave was oracle founder larry ellison's $173 million purchase of billionaire jim clark's oceanfront estate last year.palm beach is the most expensive real estate market in the country, with an average sale price of nearly $13 million, according to douglas elliman and miller samuel. many homes saw their prices more than triple during the pandemic as ultra-wealthy buyers from the northeast fled to florida, and the coveted properties in palm beach in particular. christopher leavitt of douglas elliman, who is listing the property alongside christian angle real estate, said interest in the property has been strong, especially from hedge fund managers and finance chiefs looking to relocate south. ""the buyer of this home is someone who wants the one and only private island on the island of palm beach, surrounded 360 degrees by water, accessible by your boat or a private bridge,"" leavitt said. ""it's somebody who wants that one property that no one else has, that one trophy property."" glaser declined to say what profit he would make if the home sells for its asking price. he added that he and his investors spent ""a fortune"" on the new home and improvements. but he said the buyer will be making a long-term investment. ""whoever buys this house, in five years they're going to be very happy with the purchase,"" he said. ""it's a legacy property that they'll own for the rest of their lives."""

""however, we see downside to the company's margin outlook with the company targeting revenue per vehicle of ~$1k which we believe implies asps [average selling prices] roughly 50-100% higher than key competitors.""simply put, while delaney acknowledges that luminar is one of only a few lidar makers winning deals with major automakers, he thinks that luminar won't be able to get the prices it's hoping to get from those automakers. and based on 2025 revenue assumptions, he sees luminar trading at four times the valuation of competitors innoviz and hesai, both of which have also won business from automakers.""one, our tech is better, and people typically pay a premium for tech, but to us this isn't a theoretical exercise: this is pricing that we actually have in place,"" fennimore told cnbc in an interview on friday morning.fennimore's letter points out that luminar has already signed contracts to provide hardware and software for over 20 upcoming new vehicles from major automakers including volvo, polestar, mercedes-benz and chinese auto giant saic motor. those contracts lock in pricing through the life of those upcoming models, he said.""'premium pricing' isn't a theoretical concept we are forecasting, but an achievement we have already made in our major customer contracts,"" fennimore wrote in the shareholder letter.and the second point fennimore says goldman missed: the time frame delaney chose to compare luminar's valuation against those of its rivals.""we believe using 2025 revenue as a valuation benchmark versus peers dramatically undervalues luminar, as many of the 20+ vehicle lines we have been awarded are not expected to reach production until beyond 2025,"" he wrote.put another way, some of the big contracts that luminar has already signed won't generate significant revenue until those vehicles launch in the second half of the decade, fennimore said.the decision to take the rebuttal directly to luminar's shareholders is unusual, but fennimore believes it's warranted – and he hinted that luminar might choose to send more letters like this in the future.""whenever anybody raises valid and thoughtful concerns about us, we want to respond with valid and thoughtful facts,"" fennimore told cnbc.

""we are positioning neutron to compete directly with the falcon 9,"" rocket lab chief financial officer adam spice said earlier this week, speaking at a bank of america event in london on tuesday. the company announced neutron when it went public in 2021, with spice saying the rocket remains on track to debut in 2024. during its fourth-quarter report last month, rocket lab said it had begun producing the first tank structures of neutron, as well as construction of the launch pad for the rocket. the company plans to conduct the first ""hot fire test"" of an archimedes engine, which will power neutron, ""by the end of the year,"" spice said. sign up here to receive weekly editions of cnbc's investing in space newsletter. spacex advertises a falcon 9 launch with a $67 million price tag, and spice says rocket lab is aiming to match that on a cost-per-kilogram basis for satellite customers. that means neutron is targeting a ""$50 million to $55 million launch service cost,"" spice said.spice also noted that rocket lab expects to fly the reusable neutron boosters ""10 to 20 times"" each, in range with the current reuse performance of a falcon 9 booster. ""we ultimately expect the margins to be in around the 50% range"" for neutron launches, spice added. he estimated the cost of goods for each neutron to be at $20 million to $25 million, with ""close to half of that"" coming from the upper, non-reusable second stage of the rocket. additionally, with spacex pushing hard to develop its massive starship rocket, spice alluded to the potential for the company to pivot away from flying falcon 9 missions. ""we don't have any hard data on that but certainly, if that was to happen, that'd be an incredibly bullish thing for neutron,"" spice said. in the meantime, spice said rocket lab looks to maintain its position as ""a dominant player"" in the market sub-sector of launching small satellites with its electron vehicles. the company expects to launch three electron missions in the second quarter, with two already completed, and is ""on track"" to launch 15 missions this year, spice said.spice also emphasized to the bank of america audience that rocket lab is ""much more than"" just a rocket company. indeed, the company's acquisitions and expansion into building satellite components and spacecraft has become the bulk of its quarterly revenue. ""all of this leads towards the biggest opportunity in space, which is really on the application side,"" spice said. as ceo peter beck has previously noted, rocket lab aims to create an ""end-to-end platform for customers"" who need space-based services. spice said the company wants to be operating satellites and ""delivering data to our customers and developing a recurring revenue stream from that,"" essentially eliminating the need for other companies to build and operate their own satellites. ""a lot of the companies that we're [launching to orbit on electron] now are very unnatural owners of space assets,"" spice said, adding that ""the best owner of a space asset is somebody who can launch."""

79@This LA mansion is staring down an April 1 deadline before the seller loses millions@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/24/la-mansion-for-sale-faces-april-1-tax-deadline.html@"the owner of this over-the-top, seven-bedroom and 11-bath mansion in los angeles is prepared to accept $6 million less than what he paid for it less than two years ago — all to beat a ticking clock. the home features a kobe bryant-themed basketball court, car showroom and a 70-foot infinity pool that appears to float some 45 feet above the mountainside, and it's on sale for a reduced price of $38 million. if it doesn't sell by april 1, the property would be subject to a looming new, local mansion tax, which goes into effect next month and could cost the owner a further $2 million.the brentwood estate, now known as the star resort, was built by veteran spec developer ramtin ray nosrati, who sold it back in 2021 for $44 million. according to public records, the almost 16,700-square-foot residence was purchased by the trust of wealthy investor jeffrey feinberg, who runs feinberg investments. about a year after buying it, feinberg put the home back on the market for $48 million but couldn't find any takers. feinberg brought in dan malka of ikon advisors to implement a more aggressive pricing strategy, and the original asking price was chopped down $10 million, or almost 21%. to put that price cut into perspective, it amounts to the home dropping almost $64,000 in value every single week for 94 weeks straight since feinberg bought it.trying to unload an expensive mansion in the midst of a banking crisis with the la real estate market softening and uncertainty looming large isn't exactly great timing. feinberg, like all luxury mansion sellers in la, is also contending with the new mansion tax approved by voters in november. the ula tax, as it's called, was designed to ""fund affordable housing projects and provide resources to tenants at risk of homelessness,"" according to the city of los angeles website. it's levied on the seller as a transfer tax upon the sale of a home, or any real property, that trades for $5 million or more.for homes priced between $5 million and $10 million, sellers will have to pay the city 4% of the total sale price. for real estate trading north of $10 million, the rate increases to 5.5%. the new tax is on top of the city's current 0.45% transfer tax. and it's levied based on sale price, not profit, which means sellers will have to pay up even if they're already taking a loss, as could be the case with the star resort. the city's website includes a tax calculator, which estimates ula and city transfer taxes owed on a $38 million deal at $2,261,000, or just under 6% of the total deal.for many high-end home sellers and their agents, the race is on to lock in profits and close on a sale before the new tax takes effect. but for malka, who wouldn't discuss his client by name with cnbc, the pressure is on to get the best price and rein in his client's losses before the new tax takes them even higher. ""that's why we decided to give a good price cut and send a signal to the market that my seller is motivated to sell and that he wants to move on,"" said malka, who still holds out hope he can broker a deal before the first of the month. after cnbc's report on the mansion and looming tax bill was published, malka reached back out to cnbc on friday to add that the current pricing is intended to pass on tax savings to a buyer willing to close prior to april 1. his client also intends to raise his asking price to $41 million after the tax takes effect with no intention of accepting offers below that price after march, he said.real estate broker aaron kirman of akg/christies international called the short runway to offload homes before april 1 ""crazy."" ""people had a four-month window from the day [the new tax] passed to sell a house,"" he said. kirman, who is one of la's top-producing luxury real estate brokers, does not represent the star resort, but he does have many clients who are also in a big rush to sell. it's a trend, he said, that's reflected in la's multiple listing service (mls), which according to kirman shows 86 homes with sale prices over $5 million currently in escrow.""the tax is coming out at a complicated time with interest rates, inflation and bank issues,"" kirman told cnbc. ""it couldn't have been more of a perfect storm."" the ula tax, he said, ""has led to dramatic price reductions on many homes."" potential homebuyers are swooping in with all-cash offers, and the promise of a fast-closing deal, kirman said, but at deep discounts.jonathan miller, president of the real estate appraisal firm miller samuel, told cnbc it will be hard to project the impact of the tax on any one piece of real estate, but he does have a prediction across the region: ""it ultimately lowers achievable prices as compared to the period before april 1 and becomes baked into market expectations in the future."" in other words, the new tax will create a downward pressure on homes over $5 million as owners anticipate the future cost of higher tax bills.according to miller, the rush to sell before the april 1 deadline matches a similar frenzy in new york four years ago. ""when new york implemented the mansion tax in 2019, there was a surge in closings just short of the july 1 start date and a void of sales in the following months,"" he said.kirman said even with the tax pressures, one thing will remain the same: ""the house is worth what the buyer is willing to pay for it."" and if that amount is over $5 million, there will be some new taxes to pay on it."

""because they could be missing out on people in those groups that still have an interest in going to theaters but might not be open to these newer initiatives that might be unfamiliar to them.""already, cinema chains such as alamo drafthouse have said they do not plan to implement dynamic pricing in their theaters.""we could put more rows in our theaters and we don't,"" shelli taylor, ceo of alamo drafthouse, told cnbc last month.

84@Chewy and Petco earnings make it clear: Pet health care is their future@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/chewy-petco-health-care-growth.html@"if there's one thing that's clear from chewy and petco's latest earnings reports, it's that pet health care will be key to whether the companies can grow and make higher profits over the longer term. the retailers, which both released their quarterly earnings on wednesday, began investing heavily into pet health when the pandemic-fueled pet boom saw 23 million american households welcome a new animal into their homes. the boom turned the overall u.s. pet market into a $123.6 billion dollar powerhouse in 2021, and it's expected to grow to $200 billion by the end of the decade, according to the american pet products association and new research from bloomberg intelligence. pet health care – and the high margins that come with it – is a crucial component to that overall market and is driving the growth in spending in the u.s., according to bloomberg intelligence. ""increased pet nutrition is leading to longer pet lives around the world,"" said ann-hunter van kirk, a senior biopharmaceutical analyst with bloomberg intelligence who co-authored the report. ""with this comes an increased need for spending relating to expensive healthcare for aging pets, and we project that this spending on lasting health for pets will continue to swell over the next decade."" the companies may still have to win over investors with the approach, though, as shares of both companies fell thursday. chewy, the ecommerce giant known for its convenient auto-ship services and generous customer service policies, has focused on building out its pharmacy, insurance and telehealth verticals while partnering with veterinarians to get a cut of their consumables revenues. the company, founded by ryan cohen in 2011, now operates the largest pet pharmacy in the u.s., ceo sumit singh told investors on an earnings call. ""non-discretionary categories, including consumables and health care, remain the pillars of strength,"" singh, a former amazon executive, said on the call.petco, on the other hand, has also invested into insurance and pharmacy but has focused on leveraging its brick-and-mortar footprint to set up veterinary hospitals. it changed its name to petco health and wellness company in 2020. the longtime pet retailer now has a total of 247 hospitals across the country, up from 10 at the beginning of 2018, bringing a veterinary presence to 90% of petco's stores, chairman and ceo ron coughlin said during an earnings call. ""petco's hospitals and clinics saw nearly 1.9 million pets in 2022, positioning us as one of the leading providers of veterinary services in the united states,"" coughlin told investors, adding petco is among the top 10 in the nation from a hospital unit standpoint. ""vet customers are also demonstrating a 2.3 times higher lifetime value than non-vet customers,"" he said. against the backdrop of a tough veterinary job market and a dearth of pet doctors, petco hired 1,100 veterinarians in 2022, a 40% year-over-year increase. chewy has not shared how many veterinarians or vet techs it employs for its veterinary telehealth service, connect with a vet.the fruits of these labors haven't quite materialized just yet for both of the companies. the nascent initiatives are costly to build. but in the long term, they could provide a durable runway for growth and profitability. pet adoptions surged during the pandemic, triggering a surge in demand for pet goods. with uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and an increasingly cautious consumer, sales from high margin hard goods such as toys and leashes have been trending down at both companies. at petco, where discretionary supplies and companion animals account for about 38% of sales, the category suffered a 9% decline for the full year, the company said.at chewy, which is not nearly as reliant on hard goods, the company celebrated its first annual profit in its history wednesday. but executives also repeatedly noted softness in the discretionary and hard goods categories during the company's earnings call. singh said he doesn't expect hard goods sales to accelerate in 2023. plus, there's now more competition in the hardgoods market, making it harder for chewy and petco to hang on to their market share, said jessica ramirez, a senior analyst at jane hali and associates. ""off-price retailers have a really good category and those categories continue to grow,"" she told cnbc. however, when it comes to pet care, there are far more avenues for growth and longevity. ""a puppy that was, you know, adopted or bought, during 2020 is now three years old. as they get older, they're only going to require more health care,"" said anna andreeva, a senior equity research analyst and managing director at needham and company. ""and i think both companies are being smart in developing those verticals."" pet insurance has very little penetration in the u.s. compared to other markets, such as the uk, which can ""definitely"" be changed moving forward and will be another driver in the space, andreeva said. in addition, the footprint of independent veterinary providers is dwindling, which is creating an ""interesting"" market share opportunity, said andreeva. ""there's definitely been, you know, share donation out of that channel,"" she said.the two companies share many similarities in the items that they sell and the customers they cater to but have taken different approaches to pet health. chewy, which has no brick-and-mortar stores, has focused on building out its virtual telehealth capabilities but has run into obstacles because of state and federal regulations that, in some locations, forbid veterinarians from treating an animal if they haven't met it in person. ""that is a bit of a complication and when you look to petco, they are at a better advantage because they have stores,"" said ramirez. cnbc previously reported that chewy, along with other pet companies, have sponsored a lobbying organization that's working to change those regulations and some veterinarians are concerned that veterinary telehealth could be unsafe and problematic for pets. petco hasn't faced the same issues because they haven't yet branched into telehealth, and all of their veterinarians practice in physical locations. however, it will take some time before the hospitals are profitable. ""the margins on our services business are growing. it's a three year payback on those vet hospitals and we're ahead of our model on that,"" coughlin, petco's ceo, told cnbc in an interview. either way, as the consumer continues to focus on wellness and seek more ease to meet all of its needs, branching into pet health is a positive avenue for growth for both of the companies, said ramirez, the jane hali analyst. ""as wellness continues to be a key category for us the consumer, it's also being reflected into pet,"" said ramirez. ""it only makes sense that sort of lifestyle is extended to our furry animals at home because again, it makes everything much more streamlined, much easier, so i think that's something that makes sense on both sides."""

""and the only reason that the defendant and his co-conspirators were unable to achieve their ultimate objective of entering into a reverse merger, which would have allowed for a massive payout, was because of negative news articles that exposed their fraud,"" the letter to kiel said. cnbc in 2021 published several dozen articles that exposed eyebrow-raising consulting agreements, troubled legal histories, and other issues related to people connected to the deli company. in their own filing thursday, coker jr.'s defense said the hong kong businessman relinquished american citizenship ""primarily for economic reasons and in recognition of his personal and professional life.""coker jr., who was extradited from thailand last week and kept in jail since then, was scheduled to appear in newark federal court on thursday afternoon for a detention hearing in the case, where his father peter coker sr. and a third man also are charged. but he was never brought from a holding area to the courtroom, where his parents were waiting. instead, there was a two-hour delay in the start of the hearing that ensued after the judge, a prosecutor and coker jr.'s defense lawyers for the first time learned that there is a hold on him from the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agency. such a detainer is standard when a non-citizen is extradited to face criminal charges in the u.s. during the delay, coker jr.'s lawyers met with him and talked to the prosecutor.kiel eventually took the bench and began the hearing. coker jr.'s lawyers told him told the judge that they will seek an attorney to represent him in connection with the ice detainer. the ice hold, which was lodged when coker jr. landed at jfk international airport in new york last week, could keep coker jr. in jail even if he is granted bail in the criminal case. in their letter seeking coker jr.'s detention, prosecutors cited his access to funds overseas, his citizenship from another country, his three decades living abroad in hong kong, and the 20-year maximum possible criminal sentence he faces if convicted as reasons to fear he will flee the charges. ""no evidence is more telling than a defendant's own words,"" prosecutors wrote. they cited coker jr.'s legal statement on june 5, 2019, saying, ""while i was born and raised in the u.s., i moved to hong kong in july, 1992 for career reasons and have established my roots and extensive social and family ties here. i have no intention to return to live or work in the u.s., and have therefore decided to renounce my u.s. nationality."" attorneys for coker jr. at his arraignment last week argued he was willing to put up all the money he has, about $4 million, and his parents' north carolina home as collateral to secure his release on bond in the case.coker jr., coker sr. and james patten were charged in an indictment on sept. 26 with a scheme artificially boost the prices of publicly traded stocks of hometown international, and a related shell company, e-waste, to increase their attractiveness as merger partners for private companies. while the elder coker and patten were arrested in north carolina and then released on bonds of $100,000 each, coker jr. was a fugitive for months before being found and arrested in a resort area of thailand by police there in january. coker jr. had traveled there on a passport from the caribbean island of st. kitts and nevis, where he has citizenship. in their own letter to kiel on thursday, coker jr.'s attorneys argued he remained in phuket, thailand, after learning of his indictment because he was too sick to travel. coker jr. claimed he was receiving medical attention for cirrhosis of his liver and hypoxemia prior to his arrest. ""mr. coker's appearance in the united states would have likely occurred sooner if not for serious health issues he faced in the period following the unsealing of the indictment against him,"" his attorneys argued in the filing. ""mr. coker prioritized seeking medical treatment in his local community of thailand rather than immediately surrendering to authorities and risking the possibility that he would be transported by plane to the united states against his doctor's advice."""

88@Starbucks shareholders to vote on proposals for labor probe, succession planning@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/starbucks-shareholder-meeting-labor-succession.html@"starbucks investors will vote thursday on whether the coffee giant is respecting its workers' rights and if its board is doing enough to plan for executive transitions. the shareholder meeting is the first under new ceo laxman narasimhan, who took the reins from howard schultz on monday, nearly two weeks earlier than expected. narasimhan's ascension comes at a time when starbucks is facing scrutiny from all angles. next week, sen. bernie sanders is slated to grill schultz in front of a u.s. senate panel about the company's alleged union busting. baristas from more than 100 cafes spent wednesday on strike and picketed in front of starbucks' seattle headquarters. even animal rights group peta said it plans to ""pummel"" the company during thursday's meeting over its premium pricing for milk substitutes. shareholder votes aren't binding, so the board can reject proposals even if a majority of investors vote in favor. for example, in 2021, shareholders rejected starbucks' executive compensation plan, in a rare admonition of an s&p 500 company. but a public show of support for proposals can put pressure on the board and the company more broadly.the eighth proposal on shareholders' ballots would push the company to agree to an independent assessment of its commitment to workers' rights, including the freedom to bargain collectively. more than 290 company-owned starbucks locations have voted to unionize under starbucks workers united, according to national labor relations board data as of friday. the union has filed more than 500 unfair labor practice charges against the company, alleging union busting, including retaliatory firings and store closures. starbucks has filed more than 100 of its own complaints against the union.starbucks is telling its investors to vote against the proposal but said it would have its own independent probe. ""the company has basically conceded that they need to do an assessment, that's what they said in their opposition statement,"" said jonas kron, chief advocacy officer of trillium asset management, which led a group of investors in creating the proposal. ""the issue is that they are being very hand wavy and vague about exactly what it is that they're committing to."" trillium also filed the same proposal with apple , which has seen some of its retail stores seek to unionize. apple, unlike starbucks, agreed to perform the assessment without waiting for a shareholder vote. but trillium has more than two decades of experience putting shareholder proposals before starbucks' board. past wins include asking the company to report its workforce racial and gender data, which only won 34% of votes but prompted the company to start releasing some of that data. ""my feeling is that once a shareholder proposal hits 30%, the proposal has effectively won at that point,"" said kron, adding that management can't ignore a third of its investors. proxy advisory companies institutional shareholder services and glass lewis, which both have significant sway over shareholders' ballots, recommended in favor of voting for the proposal. schultz owns 1.89% of starbucks' shares, according to factset.soc investment group, which represents pension funds sponsored by unions, crafted proposal 6 on investors' ballots. the proposal pushes starbucks' board to improve its succession planning, including requiring a plan three years ahead of an expected transition. ""ultimately, we think that the board can't keep relying on schultz to return to the helm,"" emma bayes, director of esg engagement at soc investment, told cnbc. it follows last year's rocky succession, when former ceo kevin johnson shocked investors by stepping down. johnson said he told the board about a year earlier that he wanted to retire, but he left the company before a long-term successor was picked. instead, schultz returned for a third stint at the helm as interim ceo. ""this is one of those things that only really comes into the light when you have a succession that's bumpy ... overall, it's something that boards need to be focused on and devote a substantial amount of time to,"" bayes said. starbucks' board adopted several of soc investment's recommendations but told shareholders to vote against the proposal due to the three-year timeline, which it said placed artificial constraints on the process. however, glass lewis recommended voting for the proposal, and several shareholders, including neuberger berman, calvert investments and calstrs, have already cast their ballots in favor of the proposal, according to bayes."

""the fundamentals of this market are good, right? it is a very large market that's growing. sport and wellness is a key trend and tailwind there. there's a desire for innovation and style. and the key to winning in this market is simply put: having great innovation and connecting with chinese consumers in a locally relevant way,"" donahoe said. outside china, nike saw double-digit sales increases in all of its other markets. sales in north america were up 27% and in europe, middle east and africa, revenue jumped 17% compared with the year-ago period. in asia pacific and latin america, sales were up 10%. citing its strong performance in the quarter, nike now expects fiscal year revenue to grow by high single digits, compared to mid single digit guidance it gave in the prior quarter. it expects gross margins to decline by 2.5 percentage points, which is the low end of the previous guidance range given and reflects nike's ongoing efforts to liquidate excess inventory, along with other costs. in the next quarter, nike expects flat to low single digit revenue growth. finance chief matthew friend said the company is taking a ""cautious approach"" to planning, given uncertainty about consumer confidence and the economy.

""gamestop is a much healthier business today than it was at the start of 2021,"" he said."

""it's not price increases driving it, if anything it's people buying some of the bigger and more complicated sets. it's a combination of volume and value.""net profit for the full year reached 13.8 billion danish krone, or about $2 billion, up around 4% from 2021.christiansen pointed to the strength of lego's brand and its diverse product line that hits on a variety of ""passion points"" for its strong performance in 2022. these products range from themed sets of star wars and harry potter to botanical flower arrangements and muscle car replicas.around 48% of lego's 2022 portfolio was in the new product category, he said. that's on par with previous years and is part of the company's strategy for having fresh and relevant sets for all consumers. sometimes that means tapping into a popular film or television show like ""stranger things"" or expanding its catalog to include buildable wall art.christiansen also noted that lego worked to diversify its price points, as inflation and uncertainty negatively affected consumers over the past year. he said the company looked for ways to offer a wide swath of sets for all budgets.the company also has been reaping the benefits of opening stores in new markets, particularly in china. in 2022, the company opened 155 shops worldwide, around half of them were in that region. lego looks to add 145 additional locations in 2023.christiansen said store traffic has begun to exceed 2019 levels and noted that in-store experiences remain a high priority for the brand. lego has always used its brick-and-mortar locations as a place for consumers to explore new products and to get their hands on physical bricks.employees are also trained not to upsell guests, but rather to give them an experience. the strategy is based on a belief that customers will leave feeling positive about the brand — an impression that will be uppermost in their mind when they are looking to make future toy purchases.this has become a key strategy for customers in china, because they have only recently been introduced to lego bricks.online sales also remain important for the company. while it doesn't share the percentage breakdown between digital and in-store sales, christiansen said lego is seeing ""good traction"" online and its brick and mortar sales continue to fuel its confidence in opening new stores.heading into the new year, lego is looking to continue to snap up market share and to add to its 2022 revenue gains. christiansen said the company expects growth for the full year to reach high single digits."

""but things have changed as we entered our fourth quarter. we recognized that we needed to radically accelerate the transformation plan time frame. we needed to press the hyper-space button and bring the two-year goals forward quickly and exceed them now."" benioff said salesforce has disbanded its board committee on mergers and acquisitions and is working with bain on a review of the business. for the fiscal first quarter, the company called for adjusted earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.61 per share and revenue of $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion. analysts surveyed by refinitiv had been looking for $1.32 in adjusted earnings per share and $8.05 billion in revenue. salesforce sees adjusted earnings per share for the full 2024 fiscal year of $7.12 to $7.14 and revenue of $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion. analysts polled by refinitiv had expected $5.84 in adjusted earnings per share and $34.03 billion in revenue. it called for a 27% adjusted operating margin in the 2024 fiscal year, and 30% in the first quarter of 2025. the guidance assumes there will be no improvement in the longer sales cycles, additional requirements around spending and compression of deals that the company has observed in the past three quarters, weaver said. in the fiscal fourth quarter, salesforce ran into weakness in the financial services and technology industries, said brian millham, the operating chief. salesforce said it's expanding its share buyback program to $20 billion after announcing its first repurchasing commitment, with up to $10 billion allocated for that purpose, in august. salesforce shares have risen 26% so far this year, excluding wednesday's after-hours move, outperforming the s&p 500, which has gained 3% over the same period. watch: proxy battle likely in store for salesforce"
117@Kohl's posts surprising holiday-quarter loss, offers weak sales outlook@https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/kohls-kss-earnings-q4-2022.html@"kohl's on wednesday posted a big, surprising loss and a sales decline of about 7% in the holiday quarter. its latest results come as the retailer copes with years of lagging sales, which have drawn attention from activist investors and contributed to a recent leadership shakeup. kohl's also sees more lackluster sales ahead. it shared a weak outlook for the year. it said it anticipates net sales to range between a decline of 2% and a decline of 4%, including the impact of the 53rd week of the year that is worth about 1% year over year. it said it expects diluted earnings per share to range from $2.10 to $2.70, excluding nonrecurring charges. shares closed on wednesday at $27.51, down nearly 2%. here's how kohl's did for the quarter that ended jan. 28 compared with what wall street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by refinitiv:• loss per share: $2.49 vs. expected earnings of 98 cents a share in the fourth quarter, the company's net income swung dramatically to a loss of $273 million, or a loss of $2.49 per share, from net income of $299 million, or $2.20 a share. its same-store sales dropped 6.6% in the quarter.tom kingsbury, kohl's newly named ceo, attributed the retailer's disappointing holiday results to inflation. on a call with investors, he called out kohl's expansion of sephora locations in its stores as one of its successes. it plans to open the beauty shops in all of its more than 1,000 stores. but he acknowledged kohl's has ""lost some ground in other key categories,"" he said. ""candidly, i know we can do better."" store sales patterns improved as the fourth quarter went on, as more sephora shops opened in stores and kohl's offered more items on clearance after the holidays. digital sales declined 12% year over year and made up 37% of total sales. kingsbury asked for patience, as the retailer tries to turns its sales around while catering to middle-income consumers who have become more cautious with spending. ""the full impact of our efforts will take some time. it won't happen overnight,"" he said. ""and we must acknowledge that we are implementing these changes in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop."" kingsbury has begun putting together his new leadership team. earlier this week, kohl's announced the hire of dave alves, a 30-year retail veteran, as its new chief operating officer. he will step into the role in april. last month, it named nick jones chief merchandising and digital officer. jones, who will start this month, has worked with well-known u.k. retail names, including department store marks & spencer and fashion brand george. he said kohl's wants to expand its women's dress business, increase sales for home decor and ""become a destination for gifting."" sales of kohl's private brands, which tend to be lower priced, were roughly flat in the quarter year over year, chief financial officer jill timm said on the investor call. sales of national brands declined by a high single-digit percentage due to weaker sales of active clothing, home goods and denim. accessories, a category that includes beauty items, handbags and luggage, was its strongest business, growing by a mid single-digit percentage versus last year. men's and women's apparel outperformed the company average. the home, footwear and children's departments underperformed the company average.kohl's is not the only retailer that has felt a pullback as consumers spend more on food, housing and other necessities. walmart , target and macy's have also cited inflationary pressures. yet kohl's has missed out on the significant sales gains of the early years of the covid pandemic, a time when consumers had extra dollars from stimulus checks and were largely spending on goods instead of services. overall retail spending has grown by 28.4% compared with 2019, according to an analysis by research firm globaldata. during that same three-year period, spending at kohl's fell by 15.4% and profit at the company plummeted by 203%. as kohl's performance lagged, it became a target for activist investors. it's recently had leadership changes, too. then-ceo michelle gass announced in november that she was leaving to become president and ceo-in-training at levi strauss & co. her departure came after ancora holdings and macellum advisors questioned kohl's turnaround strategy, pushed for improvement to its sales trends and called for new leadership. pressure from those investors gained momentum after kohl's ended talks over the summer to sell to the franchise group, owner of the vitamin shoppe. kohl's announced last month that kingsbury, who served as interim ceo, would step into the position permanently. he is the former ceo of burlington stores. it said at the time that it had reached a cooperative agreement with macellum advisors, as it named kingsbury to the role. the retailer had declined to provide a holiday-quarter outlook and pulled its full-year guidance in november, saying inflation had hurt consumer spending and made future sales patterns hard to predict. along with other retailers, kohl's has also struggled with a glut of unsold inventory as shoppers bought less of categories like home goods and activewear that had been popular during the pandemic. that's forced companies to turn to more markdowns. kohl's inventory remains elevated, up 4% year over year as of the end of the fourth quarter, the company said. as of tuesday's close, kohl's stock is up about 11% this year, outperforming the approximately 3% gain of the s&p 500. its shares closed at $28.04, bringing the company's market value to nearly $3.1 billion."

119@Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/companies/goldman-sachs-kevin-hassett-trump/index.html?section=money_news_economy@kevin hassett, one of president donald trump’s top economic advisers, suggested that goldman sachs may be slanting its economic research to help democrats ahead of the midterm elections.the goldman sachs economics team “almost at times looks like the democratic opposition,” hassett told cnn’s poppy harlow on tuesday.the comment came after harlow asked hassett about a goldman sachs research report warning that a 25% us tariff on all imports from china could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019.hassett said he hadn’t read the research, but went on to criticize goldman’s track record. hassett claimed its analysis of last year’s tax cuts was “really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way.” he said goldman’s analysis predicted the tax cuts would be “really harmful” to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed.“so maybe they’re just trying to make a partisan point before the elections,” said hassett, chairman of trump’s council of economic advisers.keep in mind that goldman sachs (gs), like other investment banks, charges clients to access their economic and market insights. investors rely on that research to be nonpartisan.goldman sachs declined to comment about the criticism.it marks another chapter in team trump’s love-hate relationship with goldman sachs, the most powerful firm on wall street.trump blasted goldman sachs during the 2016 presidential campaign. he claimed goldman sachs had “total, total control” over his rivals hillary clinton and ted cruz.trump’s closing campaign ad flashed an image of lloyd blankfein, then the ceo of goldman sachs, as the candidate’s narration condemned the “global power structure” for robbing america’s working class.after the election, trump reversed course.he named former goldman sachs partner steve mnuchin to the powerful role of treasury secretary. trump hired gary cohn, a registered democrat who was then president of goldman sachs, to be the face of his economic team. (cohn left earlier this year because of a disagreement over trade.)in the 2016 race, clinton received $388,426 from individuals at goldman sachs, more than any other candidate, according to opensecrets. trump received $5,607, according to opensecrets. then again, goldman sachs employees contributed more to republicans than democrats overall in 2016 federal races.however, after the election, blankfein gave trump credit for the soaring american economy.“if the president didn’t win, and hillary clinton won … i bet you the economy is higher today than it otherwise would be,” blankfein told cnn in february.veterans of goldman sachs have gone on to work in republican and democratic administrations. robert rubin, the former co-chairman of goldman sachs, served as treasury secretary under former president bill clinton.hank paulson had been the chairman and ceo of goldman sachs before leading the treasury department under former president george w. bush during the 2008 financial crisis.

""this is simply not true.""the chinese government plays a significant role in setting the value of the yuan and how it trades. economists generally agree beijing kept the currency artificially low in the past, but they are skeptical that government intervention has driven it down against the dollar and other major currencies this year.they say the escalating trade war with the united states and concerns over a slowdown in the chinese economy have helped push the yuan lower at a time when the us federal reserve is steadily raising interest rates. that policy makes it more attractive for investors to hold assets in us dollars, prompting them to sell other currencies.sudden drops in the yuan in 2015 and early 2016 set off turmoil in global markets as money poured out of china's economy. beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping it up.china will ""work to create conditions for keeping the value of the yuan stable,"" li said wednesday.his words weren't enough to convince everyone, though.""manipulation has occurred and is occurring, and i hope that action is taken,"" todd rokita, a trump-supporting congressman from indiana, told cnn at the tianjin conference just minutes after li's speech."
121@The next big test for Elon Musk arrives this week@http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/30/investing/stocks-week-ahead-tesla-elon-musk/index.html?section=money_news_economy@1. back to business: the sec is off elon musk’s back. now he and tesla can return to that other pesky problem — making and selling cars.tesla will turn in a critical production report on tuesday that will show investors whether the company can sustain and surpass its long-promised target of building 5,000 model 3s per week.that report will go a long way toward determining whether tesla (tsla) can fulfill musk’s pledge to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters.since it went public, tesla has recorded only two quarters in the black. it posted the largest loss in its history in the second quarter as it cranked up production to clear the 5,000 bar in the last week of june.that seems like a long time ago. in early august, musk sent the tweet that led to his tangle with regulators — a cryptic announcement that he had “funding secured” to take tesla private at $420 per share.the sec said he had no such thing, and sued musk last week for misleading investors.under a settlement announced saturday, musk agreed to step aside as chairman for three years, and he and tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines. musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement.the sec lawsuit may be behind him, but tesla still has some serious ious coming up. a total of $2.7 billion of tesla debt is due this year and next, according to goldman sachs.that’s one reason the production and profit targets are so important: tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt.the markets have reflected investors’ worry. tesla bonds maturing in august 2025 traded at 84.5 cents on the dollar on friday, close to a record low. and tesla stock has fallen 31% from its high in the hours after the ill-fated tweet.the stock may bounce back monday, now that the uncertainty over musk’s future is removed. but wall street still wants something else — results.2. jobs, jobs, jobs: analysts expect another month of solid growth when the us labor department issues its september jobs report on friday.more important may be the wage growth figure: will it hit 3% for the first time since april 2009? if so, will that unnerve investors worried about an overly aggressive federal reserve?3. changing of the guard at goldman: lloyd blankfein is ending his run as ceo of goldman sachs (gs) on monday. he will be replaced by goldman president — and part-time dj — david solomon.the investment firm’s stock is down more than 10% since beginning of the year. solomon will need to deal with lower revenue from goldman’s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell bonds, commodities and currencies.4. earnings watch: it’s a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are pepsi (pep), stitch fix, bon-ton and costco.for pepsi, this will be the last earnings report under ceo indra nooyi, soon to be succeeded by the company’s global operations chief, ramon laguarta. the stock could use a caffeine boost: it’s down 7% this year.5. rebooting business news: on thursday, cnnmoney becomes the all-new cnn business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward.this new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind.

""it doesn't necessarily mean they see something wrong.""trimtabs does not break down how many of the insider sales were pre-planned. the sec allows executives to schedule stock sales ahead of time to avoid the appearance of insider trading.while the captains of corporate america are cashing out, they are doing the exact opposite with shareholder money.us public companies have authorized a stunning $827.4 billion of stock buybacks in 2018 -- already a record for any year, according to trimtabs. apple (aapl) alone announced plans last quarter for $100 billion of buybacks.the flurry of buybacks has been viewed by investors as a sign of confidence among ceos.""insiders aren't announcing buybacks because they think stocks are cheap,"" said david santschi, director of liquidity research at trimtabs. ""what they're doing with shareholders' money and their own is quite different.""companies use buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders. share repurchases benefit investors -- and executives that are paid mostly in stock -- by providing persistent demand that tends to boost prices. buybacks also artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.corporate america is enjoying record profitability thanks to the strong economy and a big reduction in what they owe uncle sam. the republican tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and also gave companies a break on foreign profits that are returned to the united states.the tax windfall has also enabled companies to spend more on job-creating investments like new equipment and research projects. but buybacks are growing even faster. in fact, goldman sachs found that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by s&p 500 companies for the first time in a decade.given the spike in buybacks, saluzzi said it would be odd if insiders are rapidly dumping shares outside of preplanned transactions.""you've got to raise your eyebrows and look at what's going on here,"" saluzzi said."

""the fed is still saying that they will likely raise rates slowly and steadily but the market seems to be betting they will stop sooner.""birk added the fed had been run by so-called doves, people like former fed chairs ben bernanke and janet yellen who preferred to keep rates low, for years. investors are trying to adjust to the new mindset at the fed.""the market is still getting used to the idea that the fed will be more balanced and more hawkish,"" birk said.in other words, investors may be underestimating the willingness of the fed to keep raising rates -- despite criticism from president donald trump about rate hikes and even if the data doesn't conclusively show inflation picking up in a meaningful way.still, some experts think the fed is likely to stick to its path of gradual rate increases. powell, like his predecessors, is probably not interested in rattling the bond and stock markets with surprise moves.""we do not see rising interest rates as a reason to sell stocks, particularly in the absence of runaway inflation,"" wrote john lynch, chief investment strategist for lpl financial, in a report tuesday.inflation is still under control for nowwage growth is picking up, but that hasn't led to a big spike in consumer prices. so the fed may still have some wiggle room to keep raising rates since the economy appears to be on solid footing.""the market is interpreting higher rates as a response to better growth, not as a reason to fear a policy mistake, which we find encouraging,"" lynch added.ed keon, chief investment strategist at qma, isn't overly worried about inflation getting out of control either.""it's premature to say the fed is behind the curve,"" said keon.

""boards won't release capital to invest because they're not sure of the environment.""many companies have put investments on hold following the vote for brexit because they don't know whether they'll face new regulations, tariffs or customs checks at borders. it's also unclear if they'll be able to move staff between the european union and the united kingdom, or be forced to pay new taxes.bmw (bmwyy) said tuesday that it would shut its mini factory in england for one month of maintenance immediately after brexit because it can't be sure of getting the parts it needs. jaguar cited uncertainty over brexit as one reason for putting 1,000 workers on a three-day work week until christmas.some executives have pinned their hopes on a proposal developed by british prime minister theresa may that would maintain close trading ties in goods and agricultural products and include a transition period of nearly two years.but the european union's top political leader donald tusk took a hard line on the plan — known as chequers — after a meeting of eu leaders in salzburg on thursday, saying the proposal would not work because it risks undermining the bloc's single market in goods and services.may insisted that her plan is the only way forward. still, she could be forced back to the drawing board by pressure from the european union, her own party or the opposition.but even a blind brexit would have opponents, including some that argue britain would be giving up its negotiating ace: money it owes to the european union.""hardliners will fight back by saying that the uk is throwing away its best card — the £39 billion divorce payment to the eu — for vague warm words about the future relationship and so would have little or no leverage during the talks on it during the transitional phase,"" said rahman.asked about a scenario where a blind brexit was followed by britain eventually crashing out the bloc without a final deal on trade, phipson was unequivocal.""that sounds very unappealing,"" he said."

130@China strikes back by going after America's energy companies@http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/19/news/companies/china-lng-tariffs-trade-war/index.html?section=money_news_economy@the united states has an abundance of natural gas that pollution-riddled china badly needs to wean itself off coal.eying china’s voracious demand, cheniere energy, exxonmobil (xom) and other american energy companies are racing to build more than two dozen expensive facilities to export liquefied natural gas, which is super-cooled natural gas that can be transported by ship.china even marked president donald trump’s visit to beijing last fall by agreeing to invest as much as $43 billion into an lng project in alaska.but this pairing of an able buyer and well-supplied seller no longer looks like a slam dunk. as part of the escalating trade war, china on tuesday said it will impose a 10% tariff on $60 billion of us products – including lng.the trade tensions could make it more difficult for the next wave of lng export facilities to get the financing needed to get off the ground.“it’s obviously very concerning. the potential for some projects to get delayed is very real,” said charlie riedl, executive director of the center for liquefied natural gas, a trade group that represents exxon, chevron (cvx) and other energy companies.the shale boom created an excess of natural gas in the united states. in a bid to get rid of the glut, the united states began exporting lng in 2016 when houston-based cheniere (lng) opened the sabine pass terminal in louisiana. earlier this year, dominion energy (d) opened cove point in maryland, the nation’s second export facility .china is the big elephant in the room. china’s appetite for lng is growing rapidly. and it’s on the verge of overtaking japan as the biggest buyer of lng in the world.that’s one major reason why the united states is planning to quadruple its export capacity by building at least 25 new facilities. lng is a centerpiece of trump’s energy dominance agenda.in the 12 months leading up until june 2018, china was the second-largest buyer of us lng, according to energy consulting firm wood mackenzie. shell, the us subsidiary of royal dutch shell (rdsa), was the largest seller.however, china has dialed back its us lng purchases in recent months as trade tensions have ratcheted up, according to clipperdata. beijing is instead turning more to lng powerhouses qatar, australia and russia.“china has been able to find willing sellers closer to its own backyard,” said matt smith, clipperdata’s director of commodity research.now, the tariffs will likely price us lng out of the chinese market, according to s&p global platts.“there are other suppliers around the world that would gladly supply china – and they don’t have a 10% tariff,” said riedl.kyle isakower, vice president for economic policy at the american petroleum institute, said in a statement that the trade situation “works against us energy sector growth and counter to the administration’s stated goal of ‘energy dominance.’”the good news is that china had threatened an even bigger tariff – 25% – on us lng. cheniere’s share price rallied 2% on tuesday in response to the lower-than-feared rate.in any case, analysts don’t believe that overall us lng exports will be dramatically hurt in the short run. there are plenty of other buyers, including japan, south korea, taiwan and latin america. and washington has been pushing europe to break its addiction to natural gas from russia.“if china buys less, someone else will buy more,” said pavel molchanov, an energy analyst at raymond james. “it doesn’t matter if it’s a chinese buyer, a european buyer or a latin american buyer. revenue is revenue.”the real fallout of the us-china trade war could be felt in that next wave of lng projects that’s in the works.due to the enormous cost to build each facility, financing hinges on the ability to sign a long-term buyer to a contract. and the obvious buyer had been china. until now, that is.for instance, cheniere announced plans in may to expand its corpus christi export terminal in texas. the expansion was backstopped in part by a contract with petrochina (ptr).cheniere did not respond to a request for comment on the impact of the tariffs from china.in august, cheniere ceo jack fusco told analysts that threatened tariffs from china may slow down talks with counterparts in china about future growth.however, fusco said that the tariffs won’t impact existing contracts. and he emphasized that the us-china energy relationship has been beneficial to both sides, including by creating thousands of direct and indirect american jobs.“china is an important growth market for cheniere,” fusco said. “we expect to sell meaningful amounts of lng into china over the long term.”

134@Corporate America is spending more on buybacks than anything else@http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/17/investing/stock-buybacks-tax-cuts/index.html?section=money_news_economy@"for the first time in a decade, corporate america is steering more money into stock buybacks than investing in the future.s&p 500 companies rewarded shareholders with $384 billion worth of buybacks during the first half of 2018, according to a goldman sachs report published friday. that big bonanza for wall street is up 48% from last year and reflects spiking profitability thanks to corporate tax cuts and the strong us economy.but that doesn't mean companies aren't spending on job-creating investments, like new equipment, research projects and factories. business spending is up 19% — it's just that buybacks are growing much faster.in fact, goldman sachs said that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by s&p 500 firms. it's a milestone because capital spending had represented the single largest use of cash by corporations in 19 of the past 20 years.and the trend may not be done yet. goldman sachs predicted that share buyback authorizations among all us companies in all of 2018 will surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever.apple (aapl) alone spent a whopping $45 billion on buybacks during the first half of 2018, triple what it did during the same time period last year, the firm said. that included a record-shattering sum during the first quarter.amgen (amgn), cisco (csco), abbvie (abbv) and oracle (orcl) have also showered investors with big boosts to their buyback programs.buybacks are typically cheered by shareholders, at least in the short term. one reason is that buybacks artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.moreover, companies stepping into the market with giant purchase orders provide persistent demand, lifting share prices.the impact of buybacks is so profound that some worry about how stocks will hold up without them. companies generally aren't allowed to buy back stock during so-called ""blackout"" periods that begin the month before reporting earnings.david kostin, chief us equity strategist at goldman sachs, warned that the upcoming blackout period poses a ""near-term risk"" to the market. he noted that market volatility tends to be higher during buyback blackouts.the good news is that large companies are investing a sizable chunk of their winnings from the corporate tax overhaul. the republican tax law, enacted in late 2017, slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. it also gave companies a tax break on foreign profits that are returned to the united states.capital spending is on track for the fastest growth in at least 25 years, goldman sachs estimates.""rumors of the demise of capital spending have been greatly exaggerated,"" kostin wrote.the growth of business spending, much like buybacks, has been dominated by some of the biggest companies in the united states. goldman sachs estimates that 79% of the growth in s&p 500 capital spending came from 10 companies alone.for example, google owner alphabet (googl) alarmed investors in april by disclosing more than $7 billion of capital expenditures in the first quarter. facebook (fb), under fire for its handling of the 2016 election, is spending heavily on people and technology. microsoft (msft), intel (intc) and micron (mu) are also accelerating their capital spending.even though ceos continue to green light vast buybacks, they have been quietly taking a different approach with their own money. corporate insiders sold $10.3 billion of shares in august, the most since november 2017, according to research firm trimtabs."
135@Lehman Brothers: When the financial crisis spun out of control@http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/14/investing/lehman-brothers-2008-crisis/index.html?section=money_news_economy@legendary investment bank lehman brothers was on fire — and no one was coming to put it out.bank of america refused to rescue the 158-year-old wall street firm without support from uncle sam. the british government wouldn’t let barclays (bcs) buy lehman brothers and its toxic balance sheet. and washington decided against another politically unpopular bailout.so lehman brothers was allowed to fail. at 1:45 a.m. on monday, september 15, 2008, lehman brothers filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.what ensued was the largest and most complex bankruptcy in american history. but that doesn’t do justice to the damage lehman’s demise caused the financial system. the implosion of lehman brothers — and the mayhem it unleashed — was the most terrifying moment for business and the us economy since the great depression.“it was the moment when the financial crisis fully burst upon us, when panic seized the markets,” phil angelides, who led the official bipartisan inquiry into the 2008 meltdown, told cnn.lehman’s failure shook wall street to its core. the dow plummeted 504 points, the equivalent of 1,300 points today. some $700 billion vanished from retirement plans and other investment funds. the panic that followed plunged the american economy into a severe downturn, now known as the great recession.today, lehman brothers and its ceo dick fuld are the poster children for the reckless risk-taking that wrecked the economy.lehman’s final days were marked by frantic last-minute negotiations over its fate.right up until the end, everyone thought someone would rescue lehman brothers: surely the firm wouldn’t be allowed to fail. bear stearns, a smaller investment bank, had been saved just six months earlier by washington and jpmorgan chase.on wednesday, september 10, south korea’s korean development bank dropped out of the running to be lehman brothers’ white knight. the news — combined with lehman’s announcement of a record $3.9 billion quarterly loss — sent the bank’s shares cratering 45%.with south korea out, treasury secretary hank paulson called bank of america ceo ken lewis to ask him to find a creative way to buy lehman brothers. put on your “imagination hat,” paulson urged lewis.but by friday, september 12, bank of america said it was bowing out unless the government was willing to help. lehman was simply stuck with too many “illiquid” mortgage assets, and it couldn’t sell them quickly enough to meet other obligations. bank of america decided instead to buy the next investment bank in line to fail: merrill lynch.“you just didn’t know what was going to happen when you got into work on monday,” said brady kim, who worked as an analyst on lehman’s trading desk. “were you going to be working for barclays? some korean conglomerate?”the one option few saw coming was bankruptcy. “they’re not just going to let the bank go under,” kim said.that friday evening, paulson ordered the heads of the big wall street firms to meet at the new york fed’s headquarters. they were told to come up with a private-sector solution to save lehman.american officials had little appetite for another bailout. they had just seized control of teetering mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac the weekend before. fed officials said paulson made it clear there would be no government help this time, “not a penny.”saturday brought an apparent breakthrough for lehman: barclays agreed to buy lehman — as long as wall street would take some assets off its hands. but the barclays deal went up in smoke on sunday when uk regulators balked at blessing the risky deal.“imagine if i said yes to a british bank buying a very large american bank which … collapsed the following week,” alistair darling, the uk’s chancellor of the exchequer, later told the financial crisis inquiry commission.with no buyers left, regulators pressured lehman brothers to file for bankruptcy on sunday night, before trading opened in the morning.lehman’s lawyers and executives left the new york fed to inform the board that no rescue was coming.“we went back to the headquarters, and it was pandemonium up there,” harvey miller, the bankruptcy counselor for lehman brothers, later told investigators.the fed rejected a last-minute lehman plea for additional assistance from the central bank, leading to the early-morning bankruptcy.“i never thought the company would go out of business. it was terrible,” said james chico, who worked as an analyst in the back office at lehman for more than two decades.tom rogers was on his honeymoon in st. lucia when the bank, his employer for seven years, went bust.“i came back, and it was just mass chaos,” said rogers, who started as an intern at lehman and moved up to senior analyst in the firm’s reinsurance business.the turmoil showed just how fragile and interconnected the entire system was. the situation was exacerbated by the near-collapse of aig, the insurance behemoth. regulators feared aig’s demise would bring down the whole system — so aig was given a $182 billion bailout.fear and panic quickly spread through the financial system, causing credit markets to freeze. even large and iconic industrial companies such as general motors were unable to receive short-term funding.“the financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of lehman brothers,” the crisis inquiry commission concluded.fuld, who had infamously told shareholders in april 2008 that “the worst is behind us,” emerged as one of the villains of the crisis. he steered lehman right into the face of an epic storm.between 2000 and 2007, lehman’s assets had more than tripled to $691 billion. and its borrowing ratio, known as leverage, jumped to 40 times its shareholders’ equity in the company. the firm had relatively little capital to protect against trouble.madelyn antoncic, lehman’s chief risk officer from 2004 to 2007, tried and failed to warn fuld against taking on more mortgage risk.“at the senior level, they were trying to push so hard that the wheels started to come off,” antoncic told the commission.for his part, fuld told lawmakers in 2008 that the pain of lehman’s failure “will stay with me for the rest of my life.”the former lehman brothers boss, who made and lost a $1 billion fortune on wall street, has made few public appearances since the crisis. he did speak at a 2015 event where he admitted he would do some things differently.“i missed the violence of the market and how it spread from one asset class to the next,” fuld said.where were the regulators?fuld doesn’t deserve all the blame. the firm’s demise underscored the wild risk-taking that regulators and ceos had allowed to become rampant across wall street.consider, for example, the 2000 deregulation of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives. regulators had little window into how these trades linked banks to one another. when one bank failed, other financial institutions fell in a kind of domino effect.even a month before lehman’s bankruptcy, officials at the fed were still seeking information on the bank’s 900,000 derivative contracts. and they were clueless about the risk posed by aig’s enormous book of derivatives.“the people charged with overseeing our financial system were flying blind as the crisis developed,” angelides said.only in 2010, with the passage of the sweeping dodd-frank financial reform law, were derivatives required to be bought and sold on exchanges.regulators also failed to get lehman brothers to slow its headfirst dive into mortgages. the firm kept buying real estate assets well into the first quarter of 2008.the treasury department’s office of thrift supervision didn’t issue a report warning of lehman’s “outsized bet” on commercial real estate until two months before its collapse. the ots was abolished by dodd-frank.likewise, the sec declined to call lehman brothers out for exceeding risk limits — even though the agency was aware.“the sec…knew of the firm’s disregard of risk management,” the commission said.lehman brothers also got away with using accounting gimmicks to mask how much money it borrowed. bart mcdade, lehman’s president and chief operating officer, wrote in an email at the time that the accounting maneuvers are “another drug we r on.”should lehman have been saved?economists will debate for decades whether washington should have rescued lehman to prevent the chaos that followed. former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke maintains that regulators had no authority to lend to a failing lehman.“we essentially had no choice and had to let it fail,” bernanke told the commission.but others say bernanke and paulson should have realized that allowing lehman to fail would deepen the crisis.“our regulatory system is made of humans — and humans make mistakes,” said james angel, a business professor at georgetown university. “the fed clearly could have done a better job of containing the damage.”the inconsistent response by washington — deciding not to rescue lehman after saving bear and before helping aig — “added to uncertainty and panic,” the financial crisis inquiry concluded.could it happen again?today’s financial system is safer thanks to the reforms put in place after 2008. banks have bulked up on vast amounts of capital. regulators are more vigilant.but some worry about the risk of another downturn, even if it doesn’t start with banks.“i’m concerned about now,” said famed yale professor robert schiller, pointing to “highly priced” stocks and rising home values.“we’re already in for what could be a repeat of 2008,” shiller said. “it will look different this time, but there could be a decline in home prices and recession coming in.”let’s hope the lessons from the last crisis haven’t been forgotten.a decade later: it’s been 10 years since the financial crisis rocked america’s economy. in a special yearlong series, cnn will examine the causes of the crisis, how the country is still feeling its effects, and the lessons we have — and have not — learned.

142@Aston Martin falls 5% in London IPO@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/investing/aston-martin-ipo/index.html?section=money_markets@"aston martin is joining the ranks of listed automakers with an ipo that values the british company at more than $5 billion. but its first day of trading in london got off to a rocky start.the favorite carmaker of fictional british secret service agent james bond priced its shares at £19.00 ($24.70), giving it a valuation of £4.3 billion ($5.6 billion).the final listing price is 16% below the top of the range that aston martin had targeted, reflecting investor doubts about whether the carmaker should be valued in the same league as italian rival ferrari.in going public, the british company is asking investors to overcome fears about us threats to tax foreign autos and the potential for britain's planned exit from the european union to disrupt supply chains and markets.aston martin, which has a history of bankruptcy filings, is now producing healthy profits.it sold more than 5,000 cars in 2017, its best performance in nine years. that generated record revenue of £876 million ($1.1 billion), an increase of nearly 50% over the previous year.earnings for the first half of this year show that momentum has continued. revenue was up 8% over the same period a year earlier, while profit increased 14%, according to the numbers that were published last month.aston martin has in recent years sought to capitalize on its high-end brand. but analysts at bernstein see several potential problems.they argue the aston martin brand is not as strong as that of ferrari (race), which is bolstered by decades of racing history and a slew of formula 1 championships. the british automaker also has much tighter margins than its italian rival and a worrying history of uneven sales.with money raised from the ipo earmarked for existing shareholders rather than investment in the company, aston martin executives could be pinning too much hope on the success of a planned suv.""given its current financials and apparently rather less robust demand, it's a big stretch for us to see how it can possibly match ferrari's profitability,"" analysts at bernstein wrote recently. ""we can't see it getting anywhere close."""

144@Tesla calms fears with strong sales numbers@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/tesla-sales/index.html?section=money_markets@a tumultuous quarter at tesla ended with some very good sales numbers.the company delivered 83,500 vehicles during the third quarter, a strong performance that should calm investor fears about logistical problems and a looming cash crunch. that included almost 56,000 of the lower-priced model 3.production was a bit below that number: tesla said it built about 53,000 model 3s. but that was within the company’s projections.only three months ago, the company struggled to build 5,000 model 3s in a week, a long-delayed target. tesla did not maintain that pace, but production was still high enough to keep the company on track to turn a sustained profit for the first time.tesla was sorely in need of good news.in august, ceo elon musk proposed, then abandoned, plans to take the company private. the sec sued musk last week, claiming he had deceived investors by claiming in a tweet that he had secured financing to go private.on saturday, the second to last day of the quarter, musk reached a deal with the sec to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as chairman of tesla. he will remain as ceo, news that relieved wall street on monday.executives have also left the company in recent months, including the chief accounting officer, who quit after less than a month on the job.tesla (tsla) stock closed down about 3% following the production and sales report.tesla will release revenue and profit numbers later in the quarter. the report did not give details on where those figures would come in. it did say that all model 3s sold at the end of the quarter were the more expensive all-wheel-drive models, powered by dual electric motors.musk also sent an email to all tesla employees over the weekend saying that the company was close to its goal of being profitable.“we are very close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong, but, to be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow (sunday),” he wrote, referring to the last day of the quarter. “if we go all out tomorrow, we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations.”the company has reported only two quarters of modest profits in its 10-year history. it has reported a total of $6 billion in losses during that time.tesla has $1.2 billion in debt maturing within the next six months, which has prompted some analysts to project the company would need to sell additional shares or debt to raise cash.musk has said revenue from sales would give tesla the cash it needs. but he also has admitted that the company has run into problems delivering its cars. that added to investor concerns about a cash crunch.“sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell,” musk tweeted two weeks ago to a customer who inquired when a promised car would be delivered. “this problem is far more tractable,” he added. “we’re making rapid progress.”
145@S&P downgrades debt-riddled GE and GE Capital@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/investing/general-electric-downgrade-debt/index.html?section=money_markets@new general electric boss larry culp just got a fresh reminder of the debt-riddled balance sheet he’s inheriting.barely 24 hours after culp became ceo, s&p global ratings downgraded the credit ratings of ge (ge) and ge capital. moody’s and fitch warned they could do the same.all three ratings firms cited ge’s elevated leverage and shrinking cash flows – an alarming trend exacerbated by serious problems at ge’s power division. ge said on monday that plunging profit at ge power will cause the parent company to miss targets in 2018.s&p pointed to “deep near-term challenges” at ge power, which has been hurt by the shift towards renewable energy. more recently, ge disclosed mechanical problems with its gas turbines.culp surely has a long to-do list as he starts work as the first outsider ceo in ge’s history. but at the top of the list must be repairing ge’s once-sturdy balance sheet. ge had a perfect aaa credit rating as recently as 2009. s&p lowered it on tuesday from “a” to “bbb+”.over the years, ge has piled on tons of debt caused by poorly-timed deals, a massive pension deficit and misguided share buybacks.underscoring the scale of the problem, moody’s said that ge’s “very elevated leverage” could lead it to downgrade the company’s rating by multiple notches. ratings downgrades can make it more expensive for companies to borrow money.the good news is that s&p updated its outlook on ge to “stable” because the firm expects leverage and cash flow will improve in the coming years.still, ge’s debt problems may force the company to reexamine its $4.2 billion dividend. ge cut the dividend last year for just the second time since the great depression.but ge’s finances have deteriorated further. s&p listed the dividend as one of several levers culp could pull to reduce debt.in a statement, ge said it has a “sound liquidity position” that includes cash and operating credit lines.repeating comments made by culp on monday, ge said it remains “committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging.”now that he’s in charge, culp will need to decide if he wants to go forward with former ceo john flannery’s plans to break-up ge. flannery’s turnaround plan included exiting various businesses, including oil and gas, health care and the century-old railroad division. proceeds from the sales would then be used towards paying down debt.but shrinking ge also makes the company more dependent on the rest of its portfolio – with ge power being the biggest remaining business. that means slumping power profit gives ge less firepower to pay down debt.
146@Amazon announces $15 minimum wage for all US employees@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html?section=money_markets@amazon is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all us employees.the change takes effect november 1 and applies to full-time, part-time and temporary workers. amazon (amzn) says the $15 minimum wage will benefit more than 250,000 amazon employees, plus 100,000 seasonal workers.“we listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,” said jeff bezos, amazon’s founder and ceo. “we’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.”the change applies to whole foods and all other subsidiary employees.amazon also said its public policy team will begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.“we’ll leave it to congress and professionals to decide what the right number is,” dave clark, the company’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, told cnn’s christine romans. “but for us, that number is $15.”the size and explosive growth of amazon give the decision importance far beyond the hundreds of thousands of people who will benefit directly.amazon is among the largest employers in the united states, and it has added more american jobs in the past decade than any other company.the decision also raises the stakes for potential workers at amazon’s next headquarters. the company is planning to create a second headquarters, known as hq2, with as many as 50,000 jobs. amazon has named 20 cities as finalists, including atlanta, chicago and washington, d.c.critics, including independent senator bernie sanders of vermont, have said that amazon does not pay workers enough. they have drawn a contrast with bezos’ spectacular wealth: he is the richest person alive, worth an estimated $165 billion.“i want to give credit where credit is due,” sanders said on tuesday. “i want to congratulate mr. bezos for doing exactly the right thing.” he said he looked forward to working with bezos to push for a $15 federal minimum.bezos responded by thanking the senator. “we’re excited about this, and also hope others will join in,” he wrote in a tweet.workers across the country have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, most notably as part of the movement known as fight for $15.supporters say it’s a remedy for widening wage inequality and will boost consumer spending, while opponents counter that it could reduce opportunities for employment, particularly for teenagers and others looking for entry level or low-skilled jobs.some companies have responded to the public pressure.target raised its minimum wage for new hires to $12 an hour in september and plans to raise its minimum to $15 by the end of 2020. disney reached a deal with its unions to pay a minimum of $15 an hour at disneyland in california in 2019 and at disney world in florida by 2021.and walmart, the country’s largest private-sector employer, which has more than 1 million us workers, raised its minimum wage to $11 in february.clark said that amazon wanted to make its change sooner.“we decided, why wait? we should really do this now,” he told romans.paul sonn, state policy program director for the national employment law project, said amazon’s announcement would put pressure on other companies to raise pay, and on congress to lift the national minimum. twenty-nine states have their own minimum wages higher than the federal $7.25.neil saunders, managing director of the consultancy globaldata retail, said that higher minimum pay could also help amazon recruit workers.“without a rise in wages, amazon would be placing itself at a disadvantage in the labor market,” saunders said. the company’s rapid growth requires “a lot of recruitment which is becoming increasingly difficult in a tight labor market,” he said. “this is especially so over the holiday season.”saunders added that the decision was “politically savvy.”last month, amazon said that the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in its fulfillment centers was already more than $15 per hour.amazon median pay last year was $28,446, according to a company filing. that comes to $13.68 an hour. the company noted that the figure includes international and part-time employees.the company also announced that it is increasing the minimum wage for uk employees starting november 1. the new minimum wage is £10.50 ($13.60) for the london area and £9.50 ($12.30) for the rest of the country. more than 37,000 employees, including seasonal workers, will be affected by the change.the current uk minimum wage for adults over 25 is £7.83 ($10.15).
147@Volkswagen dumps jailed Audi CEO amid emissions probe@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/volkswagen-audi-rupert-stadler/index.html?section=money_markets@volkswagen has severed ties with suspended audi ceo rupert stadler, who has been jailed since june in connection with an emissions investigation.stadler has left the board of management of audi parent company volkswagen (vlkaf) and stepped down as chairman of the premium brand’s management board, the autos group said in a statement tuesday.“due to his ongoing pretrial detention, he is unable to fulfill his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense,” the statement said of stadler.munich prosecutors said in june that stadler, who has worked for volkswagen since 1990, had been detained because of concerns he could influence witnesses in an ongoing investigation.he is the highest ranking volkswagen executive to be arrested in connection to a costly diesel emissions scandal that burst into public view in 2015.volkswagen previously said that stadler would be considered innocent until proven guilty. audi tapped its top sales executive to lead the company after stadler was detained.the german carmaker has admitted that it rigged millions of diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests.diesel cars from volkswagen and its audi subsidiary cheated on clean air rules with software that made emissions look less toxic than they actually were.the scandal sent its share price plunging, and trashed confidence among consumer and regulators in diesel technology. the episode has already cost volkswagen more than $30 billion in recalls, legal penalties and settlements.in a separate announcement on tuesday, volkswagen said it would offer incentives to customers in germany who wanted to swap older diesel cars for cleaner models.martin winterkorn, the former chief executive officer of volkswagen, was indicted by us prosecutors in may. he was charged with wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud american customers and violate the clean air act.matthias mueller, who was brought in to replace winterkorn, stepped down earlier this year and was replaced by bmw (bmwyy) veteran herbert diess.diess acknowledged at a press conference in april that volkswagen had “lost a great deal of trust,” and that it would take years to restore public confidence in the automaker.
148@Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/companies/goldman-sachs-kevin-hassett-trump/index.html?section=money_markets@kevin hassett, one of president donald trump’s top economic advisers, suggested that goldman sachs may be slanting its economic research to help democrats ahead of the midterm elections.the goldman sachs economics team “almost at times looks like the democratic opposition,” hassett told cnn’s poppy harlow on tuesday.the comment came after harlow asked hassett about a goldman sachs research report warning that a 25% us tariff on all imports from china could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019.hassett said he hadn’t read the research, but went on to criticize goldman’s track record. hassett claimed its analysis of last year’s tax cuts was “really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way.” he said goldman’s analysis predicted the tax cuts would be “really harmful” to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed.“so maybe they’re just trying to make a partisan point before the elections,” said hassett, chairman of trump’s council of economic advisers.keep in mind that goldman sachs (gs), like other investment banks, charges clients to access their economic and market insights. investors rely on that research to be nonpartisan.goldman sachs declined to comment about the criticism.it marks another chapter in team trump’s love-hate relationship with goldman sachs, the most powerful firm on wall street.trump blasted goldman sachs during the 2016 presidential campaign. he claimed goldman sachs had “total, total control” over his rivals hillary clinton and ted cruz.trump’s closing campaign ad flashed an image of lloyd blankfein, then the ceo of goldman sachs, as the candidate’s narration condemned the “global power structure” for robbing america’s working class.after the election, trump reversed course.he named former goldman sachs partner steve mnuchin to the powerful role of treasury secretary. trump hired gary cohn, a registered democrat who was then president of goldman sachs, to be the face of his economic team. (cohn left earlier this year because of a disagreement over trade.)in the 2016 race, clinton received $388,426 from individuals at goldman sachs, more than any other candidate, according to opensecrets. trump received $5,607, according to opensecrets. then again, goldman sachs employees contributed more to republicans than democrats overall in 2016 federal races.however, after the election, blankfein gave trump credit for the soaring american economy.“if the president didn’t win, and hillary clinton won … i bet you the economy is higher today than it otherwise would be,” blankfein told cnn in february.veterans of goldman sachs have gone on to work in republican and democratic administrations. robert rubin, the former co-chairman of goldman sachs, served as treasury secretary under former president bill clinton.hank paulson had been the chairman and ceo of goldman sachs before leading the treasury department under former president george w. bush during the 2008 financial crisis.

150@Can Larry Culp right the ship at GE?@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/ge-ceo-larry-culp-flannery/index.html?section=money_markets@general electric is turning to an outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create.larry culp, 55, is a proven leader known for his hands-on approach. he received a hero’s welcome from wall street on monday after suddenly being installed as ge’s new boss. ge’s (ge) beaten-down share price spiked 10%.culp, who became ceo of industrial manufacturer danaher at just 37, faces a monumental task in restoring ge to greatness. the iconic maker of light bulbs, mri machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals, needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt.nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from ge’s market value over the past 18 years. that’s roughly the size of facebook (fb).ge, a company that prides itself on management excellence, is so desperate that for the first time in its 126-year history it is being led by an outsider.“ge has been like watching a slow (but fatal) train wreck,” scott davis, lead analyst at melius research, wrote to clients on monday.“unwinding 15 years of bad decisions will require courage,” but davis added: “i wouldn’t want to bet against larry.”by bringing in fresh blood, ge is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under john flannery, a 30-year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as ceo to make room for culp.“ge should be commended for selecting a credible, seasoned ge outsider,” cowen analyst gautam khanna wrote to clients. culp is likely to “more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be.”culp built an impressive track record while leading danaher between 2001 and 2015. the company’s revenue and market cap quintupled over that time.the harvard business school graduate is credited with remaking danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses. he pushed danaher into health care, a business that today sells tools, lights and software used by dentists.“he’s got the chops to take over a company of this size,” said jim corridore, an analyst who covers ge at cfra research.khanna cheered culp’s history of “prudent” capital allocation at danaher, noting that roughly $25 billion was deployed during his tenure.after years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt, ge sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources. analysts say that under former ceo jeff immelt ge far too often bought high and sold low.consider the disastrous 2015 purchase of alstom, a $9.5 billion acquisition that pushed ge power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time. ge power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to $23 billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired.“the size of the writedown is disturbing,” said corridore.flannery took over a company in disarray when he became ceo last year. while he deserves credited for disclosing “dirty laundry” he uncovered, flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders.“it was really hard for john flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited,” said jeff sonnenfeld, an authority on corporate governance at the yale school of management.in a statement, immelt predicted that ge power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent.“larry culp will be a strong leader for ge and its board of directors. his expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with ge’s needs,” immelt said.now, culp must decide whether to press forward with flannery’s turnaround plan. culp joined ge’s board in april, meaning he signed off on flannery’s push to remake the company around power, its booming aviation business and renewable energy.the makeover would require ge to get rid of its health care, railroad, light bulb and oil-and-gas businesses – and use the proceeds to pay down debt.given culp’s history in health care at danaher, sonnenfeld predicted that ge could decide to keep its own health care division.ge’s vast corporate structure, built up over decades by immelt and welch, could get slimmed-down under culp.culp ran danaher with less than 100 employees in the corporate office, and davis said the new ceo will likely likely “strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms.”culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at ge power. not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy, but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems.ge also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates.and then there’s the ghost of ge capital, the financial arm that nearly killed ge a decade ago during the financial crisis. culp will be charged with safely shrinking ge capital while navigating landmines, such as wmc mortgage, the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the justice department.elsewhere at ge capital, culp needs to stabilize the long-term care insurance portfolio that suffered a $6 billion loss in january. the news prompted an sec investigation – the second ge is currently facing.by hiring culp, ge may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on wall street. but don’t be fooled: righting the ship will take much longer.
151@Tesla stock roars back@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/technology/business/tesla-stock/index.html?section=money_markets@investors cheered tesla’s deal with the sec that keeps elon musk as ceo.the stock surged 17% on monday, more than wiping away friday’s loss.over the weekend, musk agreed to a settlement with the sec that requires him to step down as tesla’s chairman and pay a $20 million fine.under the settlement, which requires court approval, musk will be allowed to stay as ceo but must leave his role as chairman of the board within 45 days. he cannot seek reelection for three years, according to court filings.he accepted the deal “without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint,” according to a court document.separately, tesla (tsla) agreed saturday to pay $20 million to settle claims it failed to adequately police musk’s tweet.last week, the government charged musk with making “false and misleading statements” to investors on his twitter account when he said he had secured funding to take the company private.besides the settlement news, tesla has another milestone this week.it is set to release third quarter production numbers that will show whether the production level it reached at the end of the second quarter — when it produced 5,000 model 3 cars a week -— was a blip or sustainable.
152@Stocks pop on new trade deal@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/investing/stock-market-today-usmca-ge-tesla-dow/index.html?section=money_markets@the stock market appears to like the new trade agreement between the united states, canada and mexico.stocks popped after all three countries agreed to an 11th hour deal to replace nafta.the dow rose 193 points, a gain of 0.7%. the s&p 500 gained 0.4%, and the nasdaq lost 0.1%.the reworked trade deal, announced late sunday night, was reached after canada agreed to give us dairy farmers greater access to the canadian market.the united states also agreed to make concessions on some automobile tariffs for cars and trucks built in canada and mexico as part of the agreement, which replaces nafta and will be called the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca).shares in major automakers rose on the news. gm gained 1.6%, and ford climbed 0.8%. fiat chrysler rose 2.7%.still, some market experts said investors may be overreacting to the usmca deal. that’s because the united states still faces another major trade battle.“while the u.s. has reached a new trade agreement with mexico and canada, growing trade conflict between china and the u.s. threatens economic growth in both countries,” said david kelly, chief global strategist with jpmorgan funds, in a report monday.eric winograd, senior economist with ab, also thinks that china-us tension will not be resolved this easily.“the us relationship with china is much more complicated than its relationship with canada. and of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with china—the chinese have leverage over the us that canada simply doesn’t have,” winograd wrote, referring to china’s ownership of us treasury debt as well as the fact that it’s a much bigger market for us exports.“i certainly wouldn’t rule out an agreement being reached with china, but i don’t think that the us-mexico-canada agreement provides a template that can be used in discussions with the chinese,” winograd added.others think that a us-china deal is inevitable, which makes the market’s reaction to the usmca agreement, a logical one.“many investors are betting there’s room for a market friendly compromise after the us midterm elections in early november when the chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25% tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in chinese exports on january 1, 2019,” wrote alec young, managing director of global markets research for ftse russell, in a report.it’s not just the trade deal helping move the markets.the surprise ouster of general electric ceo john flannery and a deal between tesla and the sec are also having a big effect.shares of ge jumped 7% following the news that flannery, who had only been ceo since august 2017, is being replaced by larry culp, a former head of industrial conglomerate danaher.culp, who joined ge’s board in april, faces a difficult task in getting ge back on track. ge also announced monday that it was taking a charge tied to its struggling ge power unit. the stock had fallen 35% so far this year prior to monday’s surge.ge’s market value slipped below $100 billion last week for the first time in more than nine years. and the company was removed from the dow jones industrial average in june after a more than 100-year stay in the iconic market barometer.tesla also rallied monday after the electric car maker reached a settlement with the securities and exchange commission that will require elon musk to step down as chairman but allow him to stay on as ceo.shares of tesla climbed 17%. the stock plunged 14% friday on the news that the sec had filed a lawsuit accusing musk of making “false and misleading statements” earlier this summer when he tweeted that he had “funding secured” for a deal to take tesla private.as part of tesla’s deal with the sec, musk did not admit to any wrongdoing. the company is also paying a $20 million fine.
153@Goldman Sachs' new CEO has a lot of work to do@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-ceo/index.html?section=money_markets@david solomon, the part-time electronic dance dj who previously served as president of the company and co-head of its investment banking division, took the reins from lloyd blankfein on monday as ceo.blankfein, who had served as ceo since 2006 and will stay on as chairman through the end of the year, is already thinking about his next chapter, which could include more “unrestrained tweeting.” he started weighing in on issues including climate change and immigration toward the end of his tenure.“i might venture forward on opinions that are my own opinions, without any regard for whether they serve the constituencies and the interests of goldman sachs,” blankfein said in a sit-down with solomon posted monday to social media.his successor has plenty to do.the bank’s stock is down more than 11% this year. it has underperformed peers, weighed down by an inconsistent trading division that doesn’t mint money the way it used to. recruitment and retention of top talent remains vital, as does the development of newer lines of business, such as marcus, goldman’s nascent retail banking venture.solomon’s first order of business is to turn around goldman’s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies.“the trading business is really what has hurt them in the past couple of years,” said king lip, chief strategist at baker avenue asset management in san francisco.the unit made up more than half the bank’s revenue in 2012, but shrank to just over a third last year, as a calm market and low interest rates pushed investors toward lower-fee index funds and passive funds.goldman’s trading side showed resilience last quarter, but not because of stocks. revenue from bond, currency and commodities trading surged 45% from a year ago, while revenue from equities stayed stagnant.solomon is willing to make changes. last month, he installed marty chavez, the outgoing cfo, as co-lead of the struggling division.at a conference hosted by sanford c. bernstein in may, solomon said that goldman wasn’t sitting around “waiting for the environment to change,” and that the firm will keep investing in technology for trading.solomon is making his presence felt with other leadership changes.stephen scherr, who had been in charge of the consumer bank, is stepping into the cfo role. john waldron, a longtime deputy of solomon’s, will take over as president and chief operating officer.“the question is: how does his new team jell together?” said stephen biggar, an analyst at argus research.another challenge for solomon will be attracting and keeping talent at the firm.many young professionals have favored silicon valley over wall street in recent years, as tech companies entice college graduates with competitive pay and relaxed work environments.goldman has loosened up, with results to show for it. roughly two-thirds of employees are millennials, while more than 25% are engineers.still, the company must ramp up diversity efforts that started under blankfein, lip said.solomon has signaled this is a priority. this summer, more women were added to the 33-person management committee. goldman also said it had formed a committee to promote the careers of diverse business leaders at the company.as trading becomes a less reliable source of income, and many competitors scale up, solomon’s goldman is expected to explore new ways to grow its business.“the supermarket finance business model is what’s working well today, and goldman is a lot [narrower],” biggar said.some of this work is underway. last year, goldman released a plan to boost revenue by $5 billion by 2020, in part by bulking up other parts of the company.and the firm has doubled down on its consumer arm, marcus. goldman, which launched marcus in the united states in 2016, started to offer savings accounts in the uk last week. the bank may expand into life insurance, mortgages, auto loans and wealth management services down the road.“we have the ambition to build a large, differentiated, highly profitable digital consumer finance platform,” solomon said in may.solomon has been at the bank since 1999. he’s expected to be a leader in blankfein’s mold, though his extracurricular interests certainly set him apart.“this is not somebody they’re bringing in from the outside that will radically alter the makeup of the company,” biggar said. “i don’t think anyone’s expecting that. but there are things on the edges he could do.”
154@California has a new law: No more all-male boards@http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/30/news/california-requires-women-board-of-directors/index.html?section=money_markets@companies headquartered in california can no longer have all-male boards.that’s according to a new law, enacted sunday, which requires publicly traded firms in the state to place at least one woman on their board of directors by the end of 2019 — or face a penalty.it also requires companies with five directors to add two women by the end of 2021, and companies with six or more directors to add at least three more women by the end of the same year.it’s the first such law on the books in the united states, though similar measures are common in european countries.the measure was passed by california’s state legislature last month. and it was signed into law by gov. jerry brown on sunday, along with a trove of other bills that look to “protect and support women, children and working families,” the governor’s office said in a release.a majority of companies in the s&p 500 have at least one woman on their boards, but only about a quarter have more than two, according to a study from pwc.california state sen. hannah-beth jackson told the wall street journal last month when the legislation passed that “one-fourth of california’s publicly traded companies still do not have a single woman on their board, despite numerous independent studies that show companies with women on their board are more profitable and productive.”“with women comprising over half the population and making over 70% of purchasing decisions, their insight is critical to discussions and decisions that affect corporate culture, actions and profitability,” she told the outlet.some see california’s law as a crucial step toward establishing better parity in corporate leadership.but setting quotas can be controversial, vicki w. kramer, lead author of the landmark 2006 study, “critical mass on corporate boards,” told cnn last month. opponents argue that pressure from quotas will lead to unqualified female members and potential discrimination against male candidates.when quotas are not set, however, companies may fail to diversify their ranks. she points to more “aspirational” legislation in other states, like in pennsylvania, where a 2017 resolution urged both public and private companies to have a minimum of 30% women on their boards by 2020. but without teeth in the law, kramer said, better numbers won’t follow.kramer said california’s legislation is weak compared to the laws in norway and other european countries, which require a certain percentage of women on boards. for larger norwegian companies, the legislation requires that women make up as much as 40% of the board.
155@Instagram gets a new chief@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/technology/instagram-adam-mosseri/index.html?section=money_markets@on monday, the company announced that adam mosseri will head instagram effective immediately. last week, instagram founders kevin systrom and mike krieger announced they would leave the company.“we are thrilled to hand over the reins to a product leader with a strong design background and a focus on craft and simplicity — as well as a deep understanding of the importance of community,” systrom and krieger said in a statement.mosseri – who joined facebook, which owns instagram, in 2008 – has held various roles at the company, including head of news feed and design director for facebook’s mobile apps. most recently, he was instagram’s vp of product. in his new role, mosseri will oversee “all functions of the business” and will hire a new executive team, including a head of engineering, product and operations.before their departures, systrom was ceo and krieger was the chief technology officer.the duo founded the photo-sharing app in a co-working space in 2010. it became a big hit, attracting tens of millions of users before the co-founders sold it to facebook (fb) in 2012 for $1 billion.with facebook’s backing, instagram continued to grow and added new features like videos, disappearing posts and, most recently, a hub for long-form content called igtv. according to instagram, the app now has over 1 billion monthly active users.while it’s not uncommon for founders to leave after their company is acquired, it’s notable that systrom and krieger stayed on for six years after facebook acquired their company.it’s unclear what the two will do next. in a statement last week, systrom said: “we’re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again … building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that’s what we plan to do.”systrom and krieger’s exodus come less than six months after jan koum stepped down as ceo of messaging platform whatsapp, which facebook purchased in 2014 for $19 billion.brian acton, the other whatsapp founder, left facebook in 2017. he backed calls earlier this year for people to delete facebook amid revelations that cambridge analytica accessed millions of users’ data without their knowledge.
156@Ryanair says strikes are hitting its profits@http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/investing/ryanair-profit-warning/index.html?section=money_markets@ryanair could be headed for a rough landing this year.europe’s leading low cost airline slashed its profit forecast for the current fiscal year to between €1.1 billion ($1.27 billion) and €1.2 billion ($1.39 billion). that’s about €150 million ($174 million) less than the company had expected.ryanair (ryaay) said that strikes and flight cancellations in september had resulted in lower traffic and higher costs. it warned that customer fears of further cancellations had led to reduced bookings, forcing the airline to cut fares in the third quarter.shares in ryanair dropped over 10% in london, leaving the stock down more than 22% so far this year. the company said it could slash its profit guidance further if the strikes continue.a sharp rise in fuel costs has also heaped pressure on the airline and its outspoken ceo michael o’leary, who is confronting labor unions after staff strikes forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months.ryanair first recognized unions in december 2017 and has since struck labor agreements with pilots in ireland and italy. it has yet to reach agreements with union officials in countries such as spain, portugal, germany and belgium.over the long run, labor disputes, shrinking profit margins and rising customer dissatisfaction could undermine the business model that made ryanair the largest airline in europe, with 13,000 employees and a fleet of 430 aircraft.rival budget carrier easyjet (esyjy) said friday it was gaining business because of ryanair’s troubles. but it too gave a cautious outlook about its earnings because of increased fuel costs and pay deals for staff.analysts at bernstein said ryanair’s profit warning is “the latest indication that the ‘low cost wins, legacy loses’ story may be coming to an end.”the analysts said that earnings at traditional carriers — such as lufthansa (dlaky) and british airways — would be less affected by rising fuel costs, making them more attractive to investors.the tougher climate is now forcing ryanair to scale back.the company said monday that it would close bases at eindhoven in the netherlands, and bremen and niederrhein in germany on november 5. it said that affected pilots would likely be offered other positions and it would seek to minimize job losses among cabin crew.

158@Regulatory framework for the loan-based crowdfunding platforms@https://doi.org/10.1787/24ad924a-en@in a growing number of oecd countries policymakers are designing specific regulations for lending-based crowdfunding platforms. in march 2018, as a part of its fintech action plan, the european commission also presented its proposal for the eu-wide passporting regime. to evaluate these new regimes, this study collects information about the regulation of lending-based crowdfunding platforms in 17 oecd countries and proposes a theoretical framework to reflect about different regulatory regimes. in this context, we explore market failures in lending-based crowdfunding and identify regulatory challenges. although lending-based crowdfunding platforms do not technically perform risk and maturity transformation, in some countries, flexible regulation allows them to experiment with different business models to provide services of credit risk management (via risk grades, provision funds, automated lending) and liquidity provision (via secondary markets). these platforms could perform the same functions as banks in the future, but there are theoretical reasons to believe that platform-based intermediation could be more stable than banking intermediation. the success of lending-based crowdfunding platforms hinges on their ability to solve moral hazard issues and overcome significant barriers to entry related to scale and scope economies, adverse selection, as well as funding cost advantage of incumbent large banks. there are also risks related to an excessive reliance on funding of leveraged and ‘too big to fail’ institutional investors that are prone to runs and moral hazard problems.
159@To what extent do policies contribute to self-employment?@https://doi.org/10.1787/74c044b1-en@using cross-country time series panel regressions for the last two decades, this paper seeks to identify the main policy and institutional factors that explain the share of self-employment across european countries. it looks at the aggregate share of self-employed as well as its breakdown by age, skill and gender. the generosity of unemployment benefits, and to a lesser extent, spending on active labour market policies appear to be robust determinants of the long-term share of self-employed in european countries. no significant relation is found between the stringency of employment protection and aggregate self-employment. however, there are significant, and oppositely signed, impacts on high- and low-skilled self-employed separately. both the tax wedge and the minimum wage appear to be positively related to the share of self-employed in the long term, but the relation holds for some categories of workers only.
160@OECD, BSR and Danone launch 3-year initiative to strengthen inclusive growth through public-private collaboration@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-bsr-and-danone-launch-3-year-initiative-to-strengthen-inclusive-growth-through-public-private-collaboration.htm@12/11/2018 - business and government should work more closely together to reduce inequality and foster inclusive growth. to help achieve this, at the paris peace forum, gabriela ramos, oecd chief of staff, g7/g20 sherpa and leader of the oecd’s inclusive growth initiative, and emmanuel faber, chairman & ceo of danone, launched the business for inclusive growth (b4ig) platform, the first global initiative bringing together companies and governments to accelerate action on reducing inequalities and promoting inclusion, with the support of jeffrey sachs, director of the united nations sustainable development solutions network.in many oecd countries, inequalities are at their highest levels in 30 years and are widening, threatening the long-term health of societies and economies, and the capacity for business to operate effectively. to date, despite a growing consensus among business and policymakers of the need for a new growth model, there has been no comprehensive effort to link business practices and government policies on inclusive growth.“inequalities of income and opportunities have reached record levels in many oecd and g20 countries and are not only damaging social cohesion but also hampering the growth prospects of our economies as many people can’t invest in the skills and education they need to thrive,” said gabriela ramos. “to remedy this and recover public trust in our institutions, governments and businesses need to work together to build a growth model that delivers for all, not just the lucky few. the b4ig platform will help drive this partnership and develop business models that place social and environmental returns at the same level as financial returns. ultimately this is good for business and crucial for ensuring the long-term success of our economies and health of our societies.”“business has a pivotal role to play in shaping a new model of economic growth that fosters social justice – a model that is more inclusive and therefore more resilient”, said emmanuel faber. “this initiative will help empower business to play this role, and strengthen its impact through close collaboration with policymakers. together, we can design a new social contract between government, business and society that creates and shares value for all.”the platform, developed by the oecd in partnership with danone and business for social responsibility (bsr), aims to create a global coalition of companies and governments aimed at generating more inclusive economic outcomes and transforming businesses’ primary role beyond maximising shareholder value to one that delivers returns for a broader array of societal stakeholders. the platform will help to enhance the corporate impact on inclusive growth by exploring and promoting business levers for inclusive growth (living wage policies, profit-sharing models, impact sourcing programmes and impact investment funds), identifying complimentary public policies, developing new impact metrics and sharing best practices.this research, data, indicators and analysis will shape the policy environment so that it encourages business action on inequality reduction, by providing competitive advantage for businesses that implement inclusive growth practices and by strengthening their impact.the platform will also serve as an “incubator” for business and government to test new policies, public-private partnerships and ideas for inclusive growth.b4ig has already brought together a broad range of figures on its advisory board, from academia (magali delmas of ucla, marie-laure salles djelic of sciences-po); business (advisory board chair emmanuel faber of danone, ana longoria of novartis mexico, gerard mestrallet of suez, nicole notat of vigeo, russell mills of business at oecd); and civil society (aaron cramer of bsr, teresa fogelberg of gri, caroline kende-robb of care, pierre habbard of tuac, and chiara corazza of the women’s forum for the economy and society).“bsr is excited to be launching the business for inclusive growth platform in collaboration with the oecd,” said aron cramer, ceo of bsr. “achieving inclusive growth is of fundamental importance to people, communities, business, and national economies. at a time of profound change, it is essential that we design and advance inclusive growth models to maintain economic vitality, social cohesion, and support for an open trading system and open societies. at bsr, we believe that this platform will generate learning, opportunities for collaboration on business responses, and a means of exploring public policy solutions.”for further information please contact the oecd media office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

164@Resource curse in oil exporting countries@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/resource-curse-in-oil-exporting-countries_a5012a3d-en@this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the “resource curse” phenomenon, i.e. the negative impact of the natural resource abundance on the long-term economic development, for a set of oil exporting countries. it distinguishes between two potential drivers of the resource curse: oil dependence and oil price shocks, and it investigates whether the resource curse depends on a country’s institutional and macroeconomic environment. the empirical analysis relies on a panel of 24 oil exporters between 1982 and 2012 and an error correction model. the paper provides robust evidence in favour of the resource curse hypothesis: a 10-percentage point increase in the oil export share is associated with a 7% lower gdp per capita in the long run. oil price shocks appear to have an asymmetric impact in the short run: the growth effect is positive when oil prices rise, while no statistically significant effect is observed when they fall. there is an indirect evidence that the impact of an oil price shock is partly offset by fiscal policies, particularly in countries with high oil dependence. in the long run, an oil price shock does not appear to have a statistically significant impact on gdp. finally, exchange rate regimes seem to play a role: a fixed exchange rate regime is associated with a higher gdp, potentially due to the presence of sovereign wealth or stabilisation funds. most of oil exporters with a fixed exchange rate regime have such funds allowing them to actively use fiscal policies to counter oil price shocks.

167@Further reforms will promote a more inclusive and resilient Indonesian economy@http://www.oecd.org/economy/further-reforms-will-promote-a-more-inclusive-and-resilient-indonesian-economy.htm@10/10/2018 - a steady economic expansion in indonesia is boosting living standards, curbing poverty and offering millions of people greater access to public services. reforms that boost growth, improve the business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises and increase government revenues will allow investment in infrastructure and increased spending on health and social services, which would ensure a brighter future for all indonesians, according to two new reports from the oecd. the latest oecd economic survey of indonesia looks at the current expansion, as well as the challenges facing the country moving forward. the survey projects growth of 5.2% this year and 5.3% in 2019, and lays out an agenda for making the economy more resilient and more inclusive.the survey, presented in bali by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and indonesian finance minister sri mulyani indrawati, highlights the importance of policies to increase resilience as global risks rise. it also underlines the potential for tax reforms that increase government revenues to meet financing needs in a growth and equity-friendly manner, as well as how tourism can contribute to sustainable regional development.“as the oecd launches the latest economic survey of indonesia today in bali, our heartfelt sympathies go out to the government and the people of indonesia over the tragic loss of life from the earthquake and tsunami in central sulawesi. this economic survey promotes policies designed to improve indonesia’s resilience to global risks. efforts already underway to recover from this natural disaster and rebuild for the future offer a powerful illustration of resilience in action,” mr gurría said. “the indonesian economy is growing at healthy rates, and a demographic dividend will further boost growth in the coming years,” mr gurría said. “the challenge going forward will be to create the conditions to ensure that future generations have the opportunities for a better life. infrastructure, education, health and job quality still pose important challenges that must be addressed to ensure that indonesia achieves sustainable and inclusive growth.”to make the economy more resilient and inclusive, the survey calls for improved targeting of social assistance, deepening domestic financial markets, better transparency and governance of state-owned enterprises, reforms to employment regulations to bring more workers into formal employment and further simplification of business regulations.to raise greater revenues to meet spending needs, the survey proposes indonesia increase investment in tax administration, make greater use of information technology to strengthen monitoring and facilitate compliance, broaden the tax base for both income tax and value-added taxes, and work with local governments to increase revenues from recurrent property taxes.to develop a stronger and more sustainable tourism sector, the survey points out the need to include infrastructure in new development plans, expand tourism skills training and consider opening new areas for appropriate tourism use.improving conditions for smes and entrepreneurs will also be key for future economic development, according to the first-ever oecd sme and entrepreneurship policy review of indonesia 2018. mr gurría presented the review in bali with minister of cooperatives and smes anak agung gede ngurah puspayoga and minister of national development planning bambang brodjonegoro.the review examines the performance of smes and entrepreneurship and provides tailored recommendations for improving the business environment and framework conditions, the strategic policy context, national programmes and the coherence between national and provincial policies.“in indonesia, small companies employing less than 20 people account for more than three-quarters of national employment, more than in any oecd country,” said mr. gurría. “this is why policies to boost sme development should remain a priority for the indonesian government.”to strengthen productivity growth in smes, the oecd suggests increasing government spending on skills upgrading and innovation in smes. the review finds that indonesia spends less than 0.1% of gdp on r&d, compared with the oecd average of 2.3%, and that standard innovation policies such as r&d tax credits are relatively underdeveloped.to reduce the budgetary impact of this policy, the oecd also suggests reducing the cost of some large-scale programmes, such as kur (kredit usaha rakyat, people’s business credit) – a loan guarantee with an interest rate subsidy – by increasing focus on targeted groups, such as first-time borrowers and smes from lagging regions.to improve the overall coherence of indonesian sme policy, the review recommends the integration and merger of programmes that offer very similar services but are operated by different ministries, for example in the field of business development services and business incubators.mr gurría and minister indrawati also launched a new oecd - indonesia joint work programme (2019-21) that will cover a range of national studies, policy advice and capacity building, while placing greater emphasis on bringing indonesia closer to oecd bodies and instruments. “aligning indonesia to oecd standards can lead to a more dynamic economy and a more inclusive and sustainable growth model,” gurría said.an overview of the economic survey of indonesia, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm.the sme and entrepreneurship policy review of indonesia 2018 is

has grown significantly since 2007, when the oecd designated it an enhanced engagement country (later the key partners), together with brazil, china, india and south africa.indonesia and the oecd signed a framework of cooperation agreement in 2012 - the first for a key partner – taking the bilateral relationship to a more strategic, whole-of-government level whilst providing a mechanism to jointly decide on mutual priority areas of co-operation.the establishment of the oecd jakarta office in 2015 has strengthened this cooperation still further: indonesia participates in a range of oecd

184@The UK productivity puzzle through the magnifying glass: A sectoral perspective@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/the-uk-productivity-puzzle-through-the-magnifying-glass_e704ee28-en@since the start of the great recession, labour productivity growth has been weak in the united kingdom, weaker than in many other oecd countries. the productivity shortfall, defined as the gap between actual productivity and the level implied by its pre-crisis trend growth rate, was nearly 20% for output per hour at the end of 2016. this study assesses the uk productivity puzzle and discusses its possible determinants at the sectoral level. most of the uk productivity underperformance is structural rather than cyclical. half of the productivity shortfall is explained by non-financial services (with information and communication being the largest contributor), a fourth by financial services, and another fourth by manufacturing, other production and construction. all but non-financial services and the construction sectors contribute disproportionately to the productivity shortfall compared to their shares in overall output and hours worked of the uk economy. in non-financial services, large increases in self-employed with no employees, reduced matching of skills to jobs and a lower capital-output ratio may have been a drag on productivity. stagnant productivity in the financial sector is mainly linked to reduced risk-taking and leverage, as reflected by declining total factor productivity following its steep increases in the run-up to the crisis. greater substitution of labour for capital and weak corporate restructuring have both held back productivity improvements in the manufacturing sector. some causes of the productivity puzzle pre-date the crisis, including low tangible investment, too rapid expansion of financial services, weak innovation in the manufacturing sector, and a secular decline of oil and gas industries.this working paper relates to the 2018 oecd economic survey of the united-kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm).

A review of empirical studies@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/how-does-finance-influence-labour-market-outcomes_d8651803-en@this paper reviews empirical research on finance and labour markets. preliminary themes in the literature follow. finance may interact with labour market institutions to jointly determine labour outcomes. highly leveraged firms show greater employment volatility during cyclical fluctuations, and leverage strengthens firm bargaining power in labour negotiations. bank deregulation may have mixed impacts on labour depending upon the state of bank regulations and labour markets. leveraged buyouts tend to dampen acquired firm job growth as they pursue labour productivity gains. the shareholder value movement may contribute to short-termism among corporate managers, which can divert funds away from firm capital accumulation toward financial markets, crowd out productive investment and fuel unemployment. declining wage shares in oecd countries may be driven in part by financial globalisation. the financial sector contributes to rising concentration near the top of the income distribution. finance is linked to increased reallocation of labour, which may either enhance or impede productivity growth. finally, there is limited evidence that rising interest rate environments and homeowners with mortgage balances that exceed their home’s value may reduce labour mobility rates.
192@Digital technology diffusion: a matter of capabilities, incentives or both?@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/digital-technology-diffusion_7c542c16-en@insufficient diffusion of new technologies has been quoted as one possible reason for weak productivity performance over the past two decades (andrews et al., 2016). this paper uses a novel data set of digital technology usage covering 25 industries in 25 european countries over the 2010-16 period to explore the drivers of digital adoption across two broad sets of digital technologies by firms, cloud computing and back or front office integration. the focus is on structural and policy factors affecting firms’ capabilities and incentives to adopt -- including the availability of enabling infrastructures (such as high-speed broadband internet), managerial quality and workers skills, and product, labour and financial market settings. we identify the effects of structural and policy factors based on the difference-in-difference approach pioneered by rajan and zingales (1998) and show that a number of these factors are statistically and economically significant for technology adoption. specifically, we find strong support for the hypothesis that low managerial quality, lack of ict skills and poor matching of workers to jobs curb digital technology adoption and hence the rate of diffusion. similarly our evidence suggests that policies affecting market incentives are important for adoption, especially those relevant for market access, competition and efficient reallocation of labour and capital. finally, we show that there are important complementarities between the two sets of factors, with market incentives reinforcing the positive effects of enhancements in firm capabilities on adoption of digital technologies
193@Sovereign defaults: Evidence on the importance of government effectiveness@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/sovereign-defaults_e6eb6668-en@this paper provides robust empirical evidence that government effectiveness is a key determinant of sovereign defaults. government effectiveness is measured by a broad-based perception index of the worldwide governance indicators database (wgi) disseminated by the world bank. public debt and sovereign default data cover both external and internal government debt. in a systematic and demanding robustness check with any possible sub-sample of a large set of control variables, the effect of government effectiveness is almost always robust. in addition, the effects of the five other main indicators of the wgi database on default risk are also investigated, showing that the rule of law, regulatory quality, control of corruption and voice and accountability are also robustly linked with default risk. regressions with the mortality of settlers as an instrument indicate a causal effect from government effectiveness to sovereign default.
194@Limits to government debt sustainability in middle-income countries@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/limits-to-government-debt-sustainability-in-middle-income-countries_deed4df6-en@this paper investigates the effect of structural characteristics on debt limits of middle income countries. two equations relate the probability of default to the interest rate. first, the probability of default is estimated with a logit model. second, the assumption of non-arbitrage opportunity on the sovereign bond market relates the interest rate, the probability of default and the recovery rate. this model leads to three situations: a single and stable solution at low debt, multiple equilibria with stable and unstable solutions at intermediate debt, and a single solution with dissuasively high risk-premium beyond a debt threshold: this defines the debt limit. it reflects the empirical evidence on default determinants: it increases with perceived government effectiveness, the export to gdp ratio and the expected recovery rate and decreases with the commodity export to gdp ratio, the size of growth shocks, the share of defaults in neighbouring countries, the risk-free rate and investors’ risk aversion. debt limits are highly sensitive to the expected recovery rate, reflecting the importance of credibility. the multiple equilibria case illustrates the risk of self-fulfilling crises: interest rate shocks can trigger the default below the debt limit.
195@Stabilisation policies to strengthen Euro area resilience@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/stabilisation-policies-to-strengthen-euro-area-resilience_140b48c3-en@the euro area sovereign debt crisis highlighted important weaknesses in the euro area design. fiscal policy did not build sufficient buffers before the crisis, which forced some countries to tighten fiscal policy too rapidly during the downturn to restore market confidence in sovereign borrowing. despite this, sovereign stress remained high, weakening further the banking sectors highly exposed to government bonds, which in return reduced further market confidence in fiscal sustainability in case of banks’ bailout. as a result, monetary policy was the main public instrument to support the activity, but its effectiveness was reduced by the fragmentation of financial markets along national lines as the crisis deepened. in order to durably sever the links between banks and their sovereigns, euro area countries agreed on a banking union. the creation of a common supervisor was a very important step in that direction. however, further progress is needed in reducing and sharing risks, creating a common deposit guarantee scheme and the application of existing rules to ensure sufficient risk sharing can take place in case of crisis. at the same time, incentives need to be put in place for banks to progressively move away from a too high exposure to domestic sovereign bonds. a step in that direction could be the introduction of euro area safe asset, which would pool sovereign issuance from various countries, in parallel with gradual introduction of capital surcharges on sovereign exposures. such progress may not be sufficient, however, for national fiscal policies and monetary policy to smooth a major crisis. the introduction of common fiscal stabilisation capacity is necessary to buttress the euro area in case of a deep recession, both at the country level and euro area level. finally, policies aiming at further cross-border integration of capital markets should reinforce private risk sharing, reducing the burden on macro policies. this working paper relates to the 2018 oecd economic survey of the euro area.

196@Building a stronger and more integrated Europe@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/building-a-stronger-and-more-integrated-europe_4ce667b4-en@europe’s economy is finally growing robustly. these positive developments provide an opportunity to renew efforts to meet the long-term challenges facing the european union (eu). the eu’s record on reducing regional income disparities is mixed and this explains some of citizens’ discontent with the european project. reforming cohesion policy by focusing spending more on items with long-term growth benefits and clear spillovers across borders, including human capital and infrastructure investment could further support income convergence. higher co-funding rates and less burdensome administration of the cohesion and structural funds could encourage greater spending effectiveness. sustained improvements in living standards are held back by weak productivity and investment in many countries. reviving the single market project, by removing remaining barriers in services, energy, digital and transport can help to spur long-term growth. deepening the single market and faster adoption of digital technologies will create new jobs but put at risk others, perhaps in lagging regions. the eu can help lagging regions catch up by reforming cohesion policy and facilitating firm creation through the removal of barriers across the single market. it can also support better those who lose out from globalisation and are displaced by technological change by making access to the european globalisation adjustment fund easier and broadening its scope not only to help workers displaced by globalisation or an economic crisis, but also due to other reasons such as automation. this working paper relates to the 2018 oecd economic survey of the european union.

197@Canada has high levels of well-being and solid growth but trade tensions and housing market pose risks while inclusiveness could be improved@http://www.oecd.org/economy/canada-recording-solid-growth-but-trade-and-housing-market-pose-risks.htm@23/07/2018 - canada is one of the oecd economies delivering the best outcomes for its citizens, according to a new oecd report presented in ottawa today by oecd chief of staff and g20/g7 sherpa gabriela ramos. canada scores highly in all dimensions of the oecd’s better life index, especially in regards to self-reported well-being, personal security and health status. canada is also undertaking several programmes to foster inclusive growth – with respect to childcare benefits, gender equality and social housing – in line with the oecd framework for policy action for inclusive growth.the 2018 oecd economic survey of canada finds the macroeconomic situation to be broadly favorable, with low unemployment, inflation on target and growth expected to remain solid over 2018-19.the greatest uncertainty weighing on the growth outlook stems from the possibility of new trade restrictions, principally in relation to the ongoing renegotiation of the north america free trade agreement. the survey points out that outcomes will depend on political decisions, notably in the united states, while showing that business investment is already being negatively affected. a second risk underlined in the survey concerns the combination of elevated household debt and high housing prices, which could lead to a disorderly market correction, potentially reducing residential investment and household wealth and dampening consumption.the survey emphasises that the rapid growth of canadian housing prices in recent years not only represents a macroeconomic risk but has also created affordability challenges that are most acute in fast-growing major cities. since 2016, both the national and provincial governments have responded to housing market pressures with policies that have helped to cut the national average growth rate of real estate prices to 2.9% in the year to june 2018 from 14.2% in the previous twelve-month period. the government should monitor the effects of recent targeted regulations, paying close attention to high-debt, low-income borrowers most vulnerable to high debt-service loads as interest rates rise, the survey says. it also recommends increasing the supply of affordable housing and better maintaining the existing social housing stock.much of the economic survey is devoted to improving inclusiveness for women, youth and older people. the report welcomes many of the efforts of the federal government to achieve more inclusive growth, including through the 2017 national housing strategy, the increase in parental leave benefits in the 2018 budget and the establishment in 2017 of the multilateral early learning and child care framework. “canada should continue leading by example and walk the extra mile to ensure inclusive labour outcomes for underrepresented groups such as women, youth and seniors. this will not only contribute to a more inclusive society, but also to a more productive economy, in the context of low productivity growth and the ageing of the population”, ms ramos said. the gender employment gap remains virtually unchanged since 2009, and women, particularly mothers, continue to earn significantly less than men, in part due to a large disparity in unpaid childcare responsibilities. outside the province of quebec, low (but increasing) rates of government support for childcare should be expanded considerably, as should incentives for fathers to take parental leave. skills development among youth should be prioritised to arrest declining skills and weak wage growth among young males with low educational attainment. improving labour market inclusion of indigenous peoples in canada is another way to boost labour force participation and well-being, and the survey argues that better alignment between federal and provincial indigenous labour market programmes, targeted work experience, expanded access to higher education and rigorous monitoring and evaluation are all important.growth in old-age poverty is linked to the indexing of minimum public pensions to the consumer price index, which has meant that they have grown more slowly than earnings. this should be tackled through further increases in basic pension payments over time. increasing the age of eligibility for public pensions, in line with life expectancy, would boost growth by increasing the employment rate of older canadians still willing and able to work. this should be accompanied by greater flexibility in working arrangements for older workers.the survey also devotes special attention to canada’s immigration system, which has been highly successful, welcoming large numbers of immigrants from diverse backgrounds who contribute to the economic dynamism and cultural diversity of the country while maintaining high levels of social cohesion. with the introduction in 2015 of the express entry system, the focus has been on the selection of immigrants with higher levels of human capital and earnings prospects. canada has also developed a range of successful settlement programmes and initiatives to facilitate immigrant integration.to further enhance the benefits immigration generates for the canadian economy, the survey suggests increasing the weight given to skilled canadian work experience in selection processes and prioritising applications from candidates with skilled work experience and relevant job offers before others. canada should also expand bridge and mentoring programmes, which help immigrants with post-secondary credentials gain recognition and develop professional networks, and redirect resources for settlement programmes so that utilisation patterns better reflect needs. immigration policy will also need to continue to strike a balance between maximising ease of integration through selection of highly skilled immigrants and maximising the welfare gains for migrants by supporting migration of less-skilled migrants.on the key challenge of climate change - an area where canada has scope to do better- the survey welcomes the launch of the pan-canadian framework on clean growth and climate change and recommends further steps by governments to progressively increase the carbon price, which would make it possible to reduce overlap between other measures and allow canada’s greenhouse gas abatement objectives to be met in the most efficient way.the survey also notes canada’s disappointing productivity growth, and reiterates past recommendations to close the gap with the oecd economies having the highest productivity levels. these include reducing barriers to entry in network industries and services as well as restrictions on internal trade.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-canada.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on

198@The sustainable management of a productive natural capital@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-sustainable-management-of-a-productive-natural-capital_eaf40452-en@this paper examines an industry whose economic activity uses a natural capital on which its profit also relies. when such a productive natural capital has a limited capacity to recover from its exploitation, a free market tends to over-exploit it, calling for public intervention. the analysis is relevant, among other examples, to the case of nature- based tourism. i study the sustainable management of a productive natural capital: the conditions under which its exploitation generates maximum long-run social benefits; the various ways in which a regulator can implement such an exploitation; the rent that it generates for the industry; the effect of social discounting and operators’ short-termism, etc. particular attention is given to situations in which the regulator gives more importance to the industry than it does to consumers, as when consumers are foreigners or when the industry generates needed tax revenues. in those contexts, i find that the industry should make more efforts of conservation, rather than less.
199@Reforms for sustainable productivity growth in Ireland@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/reforms-for-sustainable-productivity-growth-in-ireland_2fd5fd8a-en@the irish economy has experienced a decline in productivity growth over the past decade. this has mostly reflected the poor performance of local firms, with the large productivity gap between foreign-owned and local enterprises having widened. given the mobility of foreign-owned firms, achieving sustainable productivity growth requires addressing productivity stagnation in the local business sector. government policy should ensure high-potential businesses can enter markets and expand unimpeded, and that the most productive firms thrive in the market. to achieve this, some aspects of the regulatory environment for businesses need to be reformed and the quality of irish infrastructure improved. access to finance for high-performing firms must be broadened as well, through restoring credit supply in the banking sector, developing equity finance and improving public financial support. it needs to be assured that government policy is also calibrated to encourage productivity-enhancing knowledge spillovers from frontier firms. trade linkages and research collaboration between foreign-owned and local firms can be better promoted. however, the ability for local firms to absorb new knowledge relies on their investment in knowledge based capital and managerial skills. these can be promoted by greater direct government funding of business r&d, supporting labour mobility across firms, and worker participation in lifelong learning activities.
200@The quantification of structural reforms: Introducing country-specific policy effects@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-quantification-of-structural-reforms_885727c3-en@this paper presents country-specific effects of structural reforms. it discusses how sizeable and interesting country-specific effects can be identified in a panel setting by conditioning the impact of individual policies on their own level or on the stance of other policies and institutions. this approach allows for the incorporation of a potentially large set of additional policy areas including institutions and policy areas with limited time-series availability (e.g. sub-components of the product market regulation indicator, housing market regulations and policies, doing business indicators and the quality of institutions such as the rule of law indicator or the efficiency of the legal system). results suggest that for instance, when more stringent product market regulation hurts more in more open economies. better institutions amplify the positive effect of r&d spending. tax wedge reduction leads to less employment gains when epl is not very stringent.
201@The Czech economy is thriving but boosting skills and productivity and transitioning to a low-carbon productive model is vital to sustainable and inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/the-czech-economy-is-thriving-but-boosting-skills-and-productivity-and-transitioning-to-a-low-carbon-productive-model-is-vital-to-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth.htm@16/07/2018 - the czech economy is thriving, with robust employment, expanding exports and falling government debt. efforts should now focus on boosting workforce skills and innovation to improve labour supply and productivity, further reduce poverty and inequality, and green the economy, according to two new oecd reports.the oecd economic survey of the czech republic says average living standards are gradually improving, with per capita gdp at 82% of the oecd average in 2017. growth is projected at 3.8% in 2018 and 3.2% in 2019, with labour shortages contributing to a deceleration from the high 2017 growth rate of 4.6%. other challenges include rising house prices, a rapidly ageing population and low wages, which are picking up but will need to increase faster for living standards to fully converge with oecd levels. “the czech economy is booming, but labour and skills shortages could create a bottleneck that would cramp future growth,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría, presenting the survey in prague alongside prime minister andrej babiš. “upgrading and updating professional skills would be a win-win for inclusive growth as it would help improve job quality, raise wages and advance wellbeing, ensuring that all czech citizens benefit from economic progress.” ( ). see the underlying data in excelgreater flexibility in work hours and more affordable childcare could help ease the labour squeeze by increasing the share of women in work, particularly those with young children.. the pressures of an ageing society could be reduced by linking the retirement age to life expectancy and broadening the financing of health and old-age care. the czech republic is among the fastest ageing countries in europe with the ratio of retirees to workers set to rise from 28% in 2016 to a peak of 56% in 2058. ageing-related spending makes up 43% of the government budget and could rise to 75% without action. the survey recommends better hospital management, primary care coordination and pay incentives to improve the financial sustainability of the health system.a new environmental performance review of the czech republic, also presented by secretary-general gurría during his visit to prague, shows the country’s progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and replacing some of the coal that dominates the electricity mix with nuclear and renewables. it says, however, that a greater political commitment to a low-carbon economy will be needed to meet long-term climate goals, including the paris agreement objectives.the czech economy is one of the most carbon intensive in the oecd due to its large heavy industry sector and its reliance on coal. the share of renewables used for electricity is the fourth lowest in the oecd. air quality is another challenge, with premature deaths from ambient air pollution around twice the oecd average at 633 per million inhabitants.the review recommends the czech republic align its energy policy with its climate policy and the paris agreement on climate change. the level and application of energy taxes should also be adjusted to impose a meaningful price on carbon. action should also be taken to divert waste from landfills and increase urban density for sustainable development.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/economic-survey-czech-republic.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.for further information on either report, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

204@OECD economic scenarios to 2060 illustrate the long-run benefits of structural reforms@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-economic-scenarios-to-2060-illustrate-the-long-run-benefits-of-structural-reforms.htm@12/07/2018 - policy choices made today can have important positive effects on future living standards, according to new long-term economic scenarios released by the oecd.the long view: scenarios for the world economy to 2060 extends the usual short-run horizon of economic forecasters to better illustrate the potential benefits of reforms to education, governance, labour market policies and product market regulations, whose effects play out over decades. in a “business-as-usual” reference scenario without significant reforms, living standards (gdp per capita) in the oecd countries improve by between 1½ and 2% per annum over the coming 40 years. living standards in the briics countries (brazil, russia, india, indonesia, china and south africa) grow faster, but decelerate from the 6% annual growth achieved over the last decade to just over 2% by 2060, leaving them at less than half the level seen in the leading countries. india and china nevertheless take up a rising share of world output – between 20-25% of world gdp each by 2060, versus a bit more than 40% for the oecd countries – as the world’s economic centre of gravity continues to shift toward asia. meanwhile, demographic change weighs on living standards in advanced countries and creates substantial fiscal pressures, forcing governments to raise tax revenue by an average of 6½ percentage points of gdp to meet health and pension needs while preventing government debt from rising.a number of alternative scenarios illustrate how policy and institutional reforms could boost future living standards, making use of previous oecd work that quantifies the impact of structural reforms. lessons from alternative scenarios include:• the briics have substantial room to improve governance and educational attainment. in a scenario where both factors catch up with average oecd levels by 2060, living standards are 30% to 50% higher than in the reference scenario.• reforms through 2030 to make product market regulation in oecd countries as friendly to competition as in leading countries raise living standards by over 8% in aggregate (and as much as 15-20% in the countries currently furthest away from best practices, including belgium, france, italy and spain).• bringing labour market policy settings in oecd countries up to those of leading countries raises the aggregate employment rate by 6½ percentage points by 2040, mostly via higher youth and female employment, helping to promote inclusiveness. combined with reforms to contain healthcare cost inflation, this package would alleviate future fiscal pressures, more than halving the extra revenue required to stabilise government debt.• tying future increases in pensionable ages to life expectancy, as some countries are already doing, raises the aggregate employment rate of older people in the oecd by more than 5 percentage points by 2060.finally, in a negative scenario, the paper shows how slipping back on trade liberalisation – returning to 1990 average import tariffs – depresses long-run living standards by 14% for the world as a whole and anywhere from 15-25% in the most affected countries.further information on the long view: scenarios for the world economy to 2060, is available at: http://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/scenarios-for-the-world-economy-to-2060.htm.media should contact lawrence speer (+33 1 4524 7970) in the oecd media office.working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

209@Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/costa-rica_a0669dc0-en@consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of gdp, one of the fastest increases in latin america over the last decade. government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked congress. while only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. however, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. as a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on costa rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of gdp each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. the current draft bill to strengthen public finances – ley de fortalecimiento de las finanzas públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. it needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. in addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the ministry of finance to regain control of the budget. there is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. the proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
210@To shorten or to lengthen? Public debt management in the low-interest rate environment@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/to-shorten-or-to-lengthen_192ef3ad-en@with still large government debt and interest payments in many oecd countries, actively adjusting debt maturity can help to minimise debt servicing costs. temporarily lengthening the maturity of new debt issuance may lower debt servicing costs in the longer term and reduce rollover risks if interest rates increase gradually over a prolonged period and to a high level. however, if market interest rates increase fast and stay high, shortening debt maturity would be financially more beneficial though at the cost of higher rollover risks. illustrative scenarios considered in this paper show that adjusting debt maturity may take several years before producing fiscal savings. they are likely to be moderate at best for most g7 countries, ranging from less than 0.1% to ⅓ per cent of gdp per year on average, with the exception of italy where they could be significantly higher. in countries where debt maturity management has small fiscal effects, lengthening the debt maturity may still be pursued to reduce rollover risks.
211@The quantification of structural reforms: Taking stock of the results for OECD and non-OECD countries@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-quantification-of-structural-reforms_6d883be1-en@this paper summarises earlier oecd work aimed at quantifying the impact of structural reforms on economic outcomes. it overviews: i.) insights obtained for the linear relationships linking policies and economic outcomes (including multi-factor productivity, capital deepening and employment) for an almost complete set of oecd countries, ii.) non-linear results on how policies interact with each other in oecd countries, and iii.) results extended for emerging-market economies looking at whether policy effects vary across countries depending on the level of economic development and whether institutions have an influence on economic outcomes. the paper lists of policies and institutions that could be used to quantify the effect of reforms. it also gives some guidance on how to quantify reforms in oecd and non-oecd countries. it provides mid-point estimates of the long-run effects on per capita income levels through the three supply-side channels. finally, it raises the issue of estimation and model uncertainty.

215@Financing innovative business investment in Poland@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/financing-innovative-business-investment-in-poland_d7605f72-en@poland’s productivity has grown strongly over the past two decades. however, the public and private capital stock is weak, and investment remains focused on the adoption of existing technologies, which weighs on future productivity gains and innovation. many micro enterprises have low productivity, and structural bottlenecks reduce start-ups' growth and their chances of survival. the eu and the government are stepping up funding for business research and development, collaboration with the public sector, entrepreneurship and innovation. this is an opportunity to improve the management of public business support, and the large new programmes should be carefully discussed with stakeholders and regularly evaluated to avoid the risks of subsidising low-productivity firms and to strengthen the take up from the most productive small and medium-sized enterprises. the sustainability of this ambitious package of measures will also require significant public revenues and promoting alternative market-based financing instruments will be critical over the medium term. ongoing improvements in insolvency procedures and efforts to reduce the regulatory burden are set to ease reallocation of resources through the economy. however, the level of state involvement would remain important, and ensuring the independence of the network industry regulators and the competition authority and a level playing field between alternative technologies, as well as easing labour mobility would be good moves.
216@Strengthening innovation in Poland@https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/strengthening-innovation-in-poland_abf2c877-en@poland’s catch up with other oecd country has been largely based on productivity growth resulting from restructuring towards more productive sectors and foreign technology absorption. the economy’s own innovation capacity is relatively weak, with low investment in research and development, no tradition of commercialising research and very limited innovation activity within firms. the government plans a higher education reform to strengthen the quality of research output, science-industry cooperation and international collaboration, which are all weak. considerable eu funding is available to support innovation. most of it is conditioned on science-industry co-operation, which is showing initial benefits. a lively start-up scene is gradually emerging, and the government foresees considerable public support for venture capital financing. yet, investment in higher education and research trails behind economies that have been able to build strong science and high-tech start-up activity. poland’s many small and medium-sized enterprises have particularly low productivity, partly related to weaknesses in vocational training and adult education, as too many workers have weak basic and digital skills. the government's education reform and digital strategy address some of these issues.

227@Firms at the productivity frontier enjoy lower effective taxation@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/b102e5fc-en@slow productivity growth in advanced economies holds back income gains and therefore improvements in well-being. sluggish productivity gains in aggregate hide a growing gap between firms at the frontier, which display sustained productivity growth, and the rest of firms whose productivity stagnates. the empirical analysis – based on firm-level data for the period 1998–2014 – uncovers the existence of a tax burden gap alongside the productivity gap: firms at the frontier pay less for each dollar of profits than lagging firms. this heterogeneous impact of taxation may hinder productivity diffusion, as it reduces incentives (and opportunities) for lagging firms to catch up with the frontier. the negative impact of taxation is particularly important when associated with cash constraints, weak demand and other framework conditions (e.g. labour market legislation, trade openness). the analysis shows that complementing tax incentives with policies to ease cash constraints would help to narrow the productivity gap.

236@Enhancing governance in Thailand@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/8ddfd4c6-en@the peace pillar of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development encompasses a diverse range of issues including stability and effective governance. reforming the public sector is high on the government’s agenda, but involves a number of challenges: the gap between planning and implementation of policy objectives remains large; insufficient public participation in policy making is undermining the efficient allocation of resources toward public needs and development goals; under-development of evidence-based regulations is hampering the creation of a business-friendly environment essential to high value-added activities; and high levels of perceived corruption are weakening business confidence and public trust in the government. thailand’s 12th economic and social development plan emphasises the importance of public sector reform. it sets out measures to strengthen co-ordination across ministries and agencies aimed at improving implementation of policy programmes, boosting public participation in policy making, improving online access to government services and combating corruption by strengthening integrity measures. the upcoming 20-year national strategy and the accompanying national reform plan are expected to pave the way for future development. however, an inclusive and consultative process will be essential to ensure the success of reform efforts. this working paper relates to the initial assessment report of the multi-dimensional country review of thailand.

239@Tax reform to support growth and employment in Finland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/412834d3-en@finland raises a large amount of taxes to finance high-quality public services and redistribute income. public finances are currently relatively solid and taxes and transfers reduce income inequality significantly. however, a rapidly ageing population pushes up public spending, while globalisation creates challenges in raising revenue. hence, ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability requires both containing spending through efficiency gains in the provision of public services and raising revenue in a way that minimises deadweight costs and distortions weighing on growth and employment. reducing further the tax wedge on labour income would lift employment. more revenue could be raised through a reduction in the range of goods and services subject to reduced vat rates, higher taxes on consumption that is harmful to the environment or health and higher property taxes. a competitive corporate taxation, combined with international cooperation to avoid base erosion and profit shifting, is needed to foster local production.
240@New OECD Framework seeks to drive “urgent, concerted effort” for inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/new-oecd-framework-seeks-to-drive-urgent-concerted-effort-for-inclusive-growth.htm@"29/05/2018 - “urgent and concerted effort” is needed from governments to drive more inclusive, sustainable economic growth that benefits everyone in society, according to a new oecd report.opportunities for all: oecd framework for policy action on inclusive growth says that despite some countries making progress in tackling inequalities, more efforts are needed as opportunities for low-income groups are worsening.to help countries assess their progress in achieving more inclusive growth, the oecd has created a new dashboard of indicators on issues ranging from income, growth and employment to education, environment and governance. over time, the dashboard indicators can help countries and their citizens monitor progress toward inclusive growth goals.the oecd has also developed the new policy framework, which puts the emphasis on ensuring low-income groups access to quality services so that they can contribute to increases in productivity, growth, and well-being.“it’s vital that countries progress in their efforts to transform economic growth into improved living standards for all,” said oecd chief of staff and g20 sherpa gabriela ramos, leader of the inclusive growth initiative at the oecd, launching the report at the oecd forum in paris. “we need to help the poorest in society achieve their full potential, and ensure that governments have the tools to deliver. oecd analysis shows that when policies targeting the most disadvantaged deliver, everyone in society sees gains in prosperity and well-being.”early numbers detailed in the new framework reveal that social background continues to determine the life chances of people in many oecd countries. overall, every third child in low-income families lives in an overcrowded household troubled by housing costs, youth from poorer backgrounds have only an 18% chance of pursuing a career in science, and 38% of their earnings will depend on parents’ situation. and in many countries, children from poorer backgrounds at the age of 15 are a year behind in academic performance from better off children, according to results from the oecd’s international pisa education survey.the report also shows how varied policy areas – from transportation to healthcare – intersect to affect well-being. for instance, social mobility is still hampered by limited access to quality healthcare services, education and transport services that are poorer for low-income groups and people living in lagging regions.to address these challenges, the oecd recommends that countries take advantage of the returning growth of the global economy to put in place more ambitious structural reforms that put equity considerations first. any short-term costs from reforms may be lower and shorter-lived when demand and job creation are stronger, says the report.the framework highlights three key areas where countries should focus their efforts to:• invest in people and places that have been left behind, particularly children in precarious conditions, through: targeted quality childcare, early education and life-long learning; effective access to quality healthcare services, education, justice, housing and infrastructures; and optimal natural resource management for sustainable growth.• support business dynamism and inclusive labour markets through: broad-based innovation, fast and deep technology diffusion; strong competition and vibrant entrepreneurship; access to good quality jobs, especially for women and under-represented groups; and more efforts to help people adapt to the future of work.• build efficient and responsive governments through: aligned policy packages across the whole of government; putting equity at the centre of the design of policies; and involving citizens in policy-making while strengthening integrity, accountability and international coordination.the oecd framework for policy action on inclusive growth builds on a range of oecd projects and strategies, including the productivity-inclusiveness nexus, the jobs strategy to be released later this year, skills strategy, innovation strategy, going for growth strategy, going digital project and green growth strategy. the oecd plans to pilot through country-specific studies on inclusive growth that would help governments put in place a roadmap to grow more inclusively.the report is available at http://www.oecd.org/economy/opportunities-for-all-9789264301665-en.htmmore information on the oecd’s inclusive growth initiative is available at http://www.oecd.org/inclusive-growth/for further information or interviews with gabriela ramos, chief of staff, sherpa to the g20 and leader of the inclusive growth initiative, journalists should contact the oecd media office (+33 1 45 24 97 00, news.contact@oecd.org)."
241@Benefit reform for employment and equal opportunity in Finland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/26e12903-en@the combination of different working-age benefits, childcare costs and income taxation creates complexity, reduces work incentives and holds back employment. major disincentives in finland are related to tapering rules for unemployment benefits, social assistance and the housing benefit, the extended unemployment benefit for older workers, the childcare fee structure and the homecare allowance. improved benefit design combined with efficient activation policies can reduce complexity and remove the strongest disincentives while minimising adverse fiscal and social impacts. replacing current benefits with a basic income would improve incentives for many, but with a drastic redistribution of income and likely increasing poverty as a result. merging working-age benefits with similar aims and coordinating their tapering against earnings would on the other hand consistently improve work incentives and transparency, while preserving social protection. once the new income registry comes online, linking benefit payments to real-time incomes, combined with strengthened work incentives, would make for a truly efficient and inclusive benefit system, fit for the future of work. this working paper relates to the 2018 oecd economic survey of finland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-finland.htm).
242@The deterioration of the public spending mix during the global financial crisis: Insights from new indicators@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/2f6d2e8f-en@the deterioration of the public spending mix during the global financial crisisnew indicators measuring the effects of public spending on inclusive growth have been constructed using recent empirical work by fournier and johansson (2016) and a recent public finance dataset (bloch et al., 2016). a first set of indicators combines information on the mix of public spending. each spending item share is multiplied with an estimated coefficient from growth and inequality equations to build both a growth and an income distribution component, which is then summed up to an aggregate inclusive growth indicator. the spending mix analysis cannot, however, measure the effectiveness of public spending within individual spending items, which is difficult to observe in a comparable manner across countries. a second set of indicators attempts to at least partly overcome this limitation by including information on the size and perceived effectiveness of governments. the average of the spending mix indicator and the size and effectiveness indicator provides an indicative overall indicator on the effects of public spending on inclusive growth. the analysis suggests that countries with a counter-cyclical fiscal stance typically have a public spending structure that is more supportive of inclusive growth. there is also a striking link between the growth component of the public spending mix indicator and the output gap: the capacity of the public finances to support inclusive growth deteriorated markedly in the countries hardest hit during the recent crisis.e62: macroeconomics and monetary economics / macroeconomic policy, macroeconomic aspects of public finance, and general outlook / fiscal policy; h50: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies / national government expenditures and related policies: general; d31: microeconomics / distribution / personal income, wealth, and their distributions; h5: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies; h11: public economics / structure and scope of government / structure, scope, and performance of government

Improving debt sustainability, tackling poverty and boosting investment are vital to sustaining the positive momentum.@http://www.oecd.org/economy/the-greek-economy-is-recovering-improving-debt-sustainability-tackling-poverty-and-boosting-investment-are-vital-to-sustaining-the-positive-momentum.htm@30/04/2018 - after significant reforms, greece’s recovery from deep economic depression is finally gaining traction, according to the oecd. economic growth is picking up led by exports. labour market reforms have improved competitiveness and are helping to create long-awaited jobs. gdp growth is projected to strengthen, remaining above 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.in its latest economic survey of greece, the oecd recognises the remarkable reform effort of the past two years. the study highlights that the credibility of public finances has markedly strengthened, after an unprecedented fiscal consolidation, boosting investors’ confidence in the country’s prospects.despite these positive developments, unemployment, poverty and inequality remain high, wages are low, investment remains depressed and productivity keeps falling. at the same time, the public administration is still facing important efficiency challenges, and while tax collection has improved, avoidance is widespread, resulting in high rates and narrow bases. addressing these and other challenges will crucially depend on the continuation of the reform effort and strengthening reform ownership.presenting the survey in athens, with the greek prime minister alexis tsipras, oecd secretary-general, angel gurría said: “the reforms undertaken by greece have finally started to bear fruit. it is an impressive achievement. with strengthened public finances and a much improved macroeconomic framework, addressing poverty and raising living standards is a priority.”to achieve this, it will be essential to reduce vulnerabilities, the report says. high levels of public debt and bad loans in the banking system make greece’s economic outlook highly sensitive to shocks such as slower growth among trading partners or a rise in debt service costs after the stability support programme ends in august 2018.additional public debt restructuring, as needed, and continuing to reduce banks’ non-performing loans, would diminish such vulnerabilities and boost confidence.it will also be crucial to support job creation and thus reduce poverty. although employment is recovering, a growing share of jobs has been temporary or part-time work, resulting in many workers earning less than the minimum wage. improving workers’ skills and ensuring they match workplace needs while strengthening firms’ incentives to invest and innovate are vital to raising wages and reducing worker poverty. the oecd recommends introducing sectoral collective wage bargaining covering broad working conditions while maintaining the flexibility of the current wage-bargaining system so that agreements can adapt to different types and sizes of firms. continuous vocational training is also essential to improve workers’ ability to find work and raise their income.the rise in poverty during the crisis has been particularly dramatic among the young. social programmes – apart from pensions – are generally underfunded. the survey does, however, state that the 2017 and 2018 reforms to consolidate and strengthen family benefits are important progress to improve the targeting of programmes to those in need. the roll-out of the guaranteed minimum income and the provision of school meals are also important steps to better protect poor households.the survey also says the government needs to build on recent reforms to revive investment. it calls for further easing of product market rules while improving the quality and transparency of regulation. continuing to fight corruption, enhance the public administration and tackling informality would improve the business environment, strengthen the rule of law and increase trust in government.overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: http://www.oecd.org/greece/economic-survey-greece.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.for further information on the economic survey, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).

248@Costa Rica: Restore fiscal sustainability and make growth more inclusive@http://www.oecd.org/economy/costa-rica-restore-fiscal-sustainability-and-make-growth-more-inclusive.htm@17/04/2018 - costa rica has made impressive economic and social progress in recent years, with robust economic growth facilitating near-universal access to education, health care and pensions. restoring the sustainability of public finances and implementing policies to fight poverty and reduce inequality will be crucial for continuing convergence toward oecd living standards and ensuring that all costa ricans share the benefits of growth, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of costa rica details the factors behind the strong socio-economic achievements of the past decades as well as the challenges remaining to ensure growth is both sustainable and more inclusive. it projects growth of around 3.7% for the 2018-19 period and lays out an agenda for achieving further transformation and greater convergence with oecd countries.the survey, presented in san josé by oecd secretary-general ángel gurría and costa rican foreign trade minister alexander mora, identifies policy priority areas for future action, led by a call to put public finances on a sounder footing. improving the business environment and enacting growth-enhancing reforms to boost productivity, create jobs, reduce labour market informality and ensure that the fruits of growth are spread more widely are also essential.“costa rica is a development success story, demonstrating how countries can achieve high levels of well-being and robust growth that benefit citizens while protecting the environment,” mr gurría said. “since the oecd accession process kick-started in 2015, costa rica has accelerated efforts to enact policy reforms that will help it converge toward oecd best practices, and this process will continue. the momentum needs to be sustained and bold actions taken in order to continue to pave the way to a better and brighter future.” read the full speech.the survey says that sustained economic progress will hinge on restoring the sustainability of public finances, which remain a major threat to economic stability, growth and living standards. with deficits rising, debt payments soaring and the ratio of public debt to gdp doubling over the past nine years, the survey recommends that costa rica implement a comprehensive fiscal package, with measures to curb expenditures and raise tax revenues.proposed legislation to strengthen public finances recently fast-tracked by the legislative assembly should be swiftly approved. a revamped fiscal rule in the bill is expected to be more effective in containing spending increases, but more needs to be done to control public spending, including substantial reductions to mandatory earmarking in the budgetary process, the survey said. in the medium term, more action will also be needed to bring the debt-to-gdp ratio to more prudent levels and create more fiscal space to address contingencies.poverty, income inequality and gender gaps in costa rica are low by latin american standards, but high when compared to oecd levels, driven by stubbornly high informality, low labour participation rates and high unemployment, particularly among women and youth.reforms to reduce labour market informality, encourage women’s labour market participation, improve educational outcomes, strengthen competition, lower regulatory burdens and boost infrastructure are priority areas to stimulate productivity and make growth more inclusive, the survey said.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at:

249@Investment as a transmission mechanism from weak demand to weak supply and the post-crisis productivity slowdown@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/0c62cc26-en@current weak labour productivity growth in many oecd countries reflects historically weak contributions from both total factor productivity (tfp) growth and capital deepening. the slowdown in trend productivity growth in the pre-crisis period is mostly explained by a long-established slowdown in tfp growth, but since the crisis the further deceleration is mainly due to weak capital deepening, a development apparent in practically every oecd country. much of the weakness in the growth of the capital stock since the financial crisis can be explained by an accelerator response of investment to continued demand weakness, leading in turn to a deterioration of potential output via a hysteresis-like effect. for the most severely affected economies, the financial crisis is estimated to have reduced potential output by more than 2% via this transmission mechanism. in many oecd countries, declining government investment as a share of gdp has further exacerbated post-crisis weakness in capital stock growth, both directly and probably indirectly via adverse spillover effects on business investment. finally, over a period when the use of conventional macro policy instruments was constrained, the slower pace of structural reform represents a missed opportunity, not least because more competition-friendly product market regulation could have boosted both investment and potential growth.

251@Basic income or a single tapering rule? Incentives, inclusiveness and affordability compared for the case of Finland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d8c0fbc4-en@the combination of different working-age benefits, childcare costs and income taxation creates complexity, reduces work incentives and holds back employment. this paper compares finland’s benefit system with two benefit reform scenarios: a uniform benefit for all (“basic income”) and a universal tapering rule (“universal credit”). the scenarios are modelled in the oecd taxben model and the tuja microsimulation model. we find that replacing current benefits with a basic income would improve incentives for many, but with a drastic redistribution of income and likely increasing poverty as a result. merging working-age benefits with similar aims and coordinating their tapering against earnings would on the other hand consistently improve work incentives and transparency, while preserving or improving social protection.
252@Multi-dimensional Review of Thailand 2018@http://www.oecd.org/economy/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm@since 1970, thailand’s gdp growth per capita has averaged 4.2% per year in purchasing power parity terms. in 2016, income per head stood at 42% of the oecd average. nevertheless, faster growth is needed for thailand to reach its goal of high-income status by 2036. this calls for structural reforms to boost economic potential and inclusiveness, by improving education and skills training in all regions, fostering innovation, facilitating domestic competition, reducing cross-border barriers and acceleratingpublic spending on infrastructure. overcoming past implementation challenges requires strengthening institutions to ensure the delivery of the critical reforms outlined in the 12th plan (2017-2021).economic development has exerted a heavy environmental toll. despite recent improvements, notably with reforestation, thailand has to further enhance the management of its natural resources to safeguard sustainable development. rapidurbanisation has put pressure on water resources and water quality. water management needs to become more effective to minimise damage from droughts and floods. solid waste has grown considerably, most of which is poorly managed. policies to better mitigate and adapt to climate change are necessaryto meet agreed international commitments and minimise economic and social losses.

254@Structural reforms to boost growth and living standards in Argentina@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/53180378-en@over the last decades argentina’s living standards have lost ground relative to other developed and emerging economies. putting argentina on a path to stronger, inclusive and job-rich growth requires boosting productivity and strengthening investment through wide-ranging structural reforms. areas that require reforms include the regulation of product and labour markets, taxes, infrastructure, skills, innovation, trade policy, rule of law and financial markets. beyond changing the rules, implementation and restoring institutional capacity are equally important. enhancing competition, for which implementation and institutions are particularly relevant, would stimulate private investment, facilitating the creation of new firms and jobs, and would bring benefits to consumers through lower prices. finding the right packaging and sequencing of reforms is important to exploit synergies across different areas, to manage trade-offs and to protect the vulnerable from the costs of adjustment. in this context, improving active labour market policies and training can support workers in acquiring new skills and in getting ready for new jobs, improving their capacity to adjust to a changing economy.
255@Tunisia: New structural reforms needed to revive growth and job creation@http://www.oecd.org/economy/new-structural-reforms-needed-to-revive-growth-and-job-creation-in-tunisia.htm@29/03/2018 - the tunisian economy is recovering, driven by good harvests and strong performance in the tourism sector, but further reforms are needed to ensure sustainable growth and higher living standards for all tunisians, according to a new report from the oecd.the first-ever oecd economic survey of tunisia highlights the significant strides that have been made since the return to democratic rule, including increased participation in political processes, new freedoms of expression and association, a reduction in poverty rates and solid participation in global value chains. the survey also points out, however, the substantial challenges posed by weak job creation, high unemployment and unsustainable public finances. it recommends structural reforms to speed up growth, boost employment, implement effective social policy and promote regional development.the survey, presented in tunis by oecd acting chief economist alvaro pereira and tunisia’s minister of investment, development and international co-operation zied laâdhari, projects growth approaching 3% in 2018 and 3½% in 2019. it says the expansion will be driven by business investment, which is expected to benefit from simplified procedures from the new investment law, and resurgent exports, which will get a boost from the recovery in european markets. “the tunisian economy has shown great resilience to both internal and external challenges,” mr pereira said. “reinforcing today’s economic recovery will require a quicker pace of reforms, with priority given to actions to improve the business environment. job creation and regional development will be the keys to making the economy more efficient and more inclusive,” mr pereira said.returning public debt to a more sustainable path will require a combination of gradual fiscal stabilisation and structural reforms capable of sustaining stronger growth, the survey said. as tunisia’s tax-to-gdp ratio is already high, fiscal consolidation should focus on reducing public spending – including salaries and pension costs - over a medium-term horizon.tax justice can be reinforced through better efforts to combat tax evasion and fraud and the withdrawal of subsidies offered to wealthy households. reinforcing the governance of state-owned enterprises and improving their financial performances will contribute to both stronger public finances and more efficient economy.speeding up the pace of structural reforms will be critical to future growth and job creation. this should include easing the regulatory, administrative and financing constraints facing businesses and creating a level playing field for public and private companies. opening the economy to competition would boost investment and employment while speeding the dissemination of new technologies.better logistical performance and facilitation of external trade should make it possible to attract more foreign investment and to help tunisian firms further integrate global value chains. the predictability of regulation, including tax regulation, will remain an important factor for investors.job creation and regional development will continue to be the key factors behind achieving more inclusive growth. lightening tax burdens on formal employment – by financing some social benefits through general taxation – should be considered. policies that promote women's participation in the labour market and their employment, and that provide better guidance on training courses that help ensure employment, should be implemented.a new regional development policy is needed to capitalise on the specific advantages and economic opportunities offered in each region. measures to encourage mobility, such as improvements to infrastructure and public transport in isolated regions and better housing policy, are also needed.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/economic-survey-tunisia.htm.for further information, journalists can contact oecd media officer lawrence speer (+336 0149 6891) or the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
256@A Genie in a bottle? Globalisation, competition and inflation@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/deda7e54-en@declining inflation in many countries over the past few decades at the same time as rising global competition has led to a debate on the importance of globalisation for domestic inflation. this paper explores the implications of global value chain (gvc) integration and market contestability for inflation using a range of industry-level and micro-data sources. we provide evidence that rising participation in gvcs has placed downward pressure on producer price inflation, by increasing the ability of firms to substitute domestic inputs with cheaper foreign equivalents. we investigate the channels, which suggests that increased gvc participation contributed to lower inflation via downward pressures on unit labour costs – by raising productivity and reducing wages – in the importing country, especially when low-wage countries are integrated in supply chains. we then present industry-level evidence to support the conjecture that a higher level of gvc integration dampens producer price inflation by accentuating the impact of global economic slack on domestic inflation. however, we also find an increasing trend in mark-ups, suggestive of rising market power, particularly in services sectors. thus, looking forward, there is a risk that stalling globalisation since the crisis, coupled with stronger aggregate demand and declining market contestability, could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term, thereby letting the inflation genie out of the bottle.
257@Global upswing should be used to implement structural reforms to boost incomes and well-being – for the longer term and for all@http://www.oecd.org/economy/global-upswing-should-be-used-to-implement-structural-reforms-to-boost-incomes-and-well-beingfor-the-longer-term-and-for-all.htm@19/03/2018 - governments must implement comprehensive structural reform programmes to sustain stronger, greener and more inclusive growth that will extend beyond the current cyclical upswing, according to the oecd’s annual going for growth report.going for growth 2018 assesses what the country-specific reform priorities are and how policy measures can be packaged together to boost long-term growth, improve competitiveness and productivity, create jobs and ensure a more inclusive and sustainable economy.this year’s edition reveals that governments continue prioritising employment and social protection reforms, which are important for achieving greater inclusiveness and a more balanced distribution of income, and that these actions have delivered results. employment rates of youth and low-skilled workers have continued to improve. however, the share of youth neither in employment nor at school or training remains high in some countries, and more needs to be done to improve the gender balance in employment and wages.the report points to a further slowdown in 2017 from the already modest pace of reform observed in the previous two years, and finds little sign of any imminent pick-up.“with the major economies of the world all enjoying a widespread upswing, a window of opportunity has opened for ending the long period of stagnating living standards faced by a large share of the population in too many of our countries,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said. “but coherent structural reform strategies -- and the political will to deploy them -- will be needed for the global upswing to be sustained and deliver a durable improvement in productivity and living standards. these reforms are difficult, but the return of strong growth means that there is a much better chance that they bear fruit more rapidly.”going for growth 2018 suggests governments should concentrate reform efforts around policy packages designed to unlock skills development and innovation capacity, promote business dynamism and the diffusion of knowledge, and preserve social cohesion while helping workers make the most of a dynamic labour market.“significant reforms across g20 countries have been too few and far between to boost productivity and reduce the reliance of our economies on macro-policy stimulus,” mr gurría said. “individually and collectively, policy makers need to find ways to address well-known growth bottlenecks and lay the groundwork for their economies, and all of their citizens, to make the most of the digital transformation.”presenting going for growth with argentine finance minister nicolás dujovne during the g20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors taking place in buenos aires, mr gurría said that implementing the report’s reform recommendations would help to achieve the g-20 objectives for stronger and more inclusive and sustainable growth.the going for growth analysis is part of the oecd’s wider contribution to the g20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. the oecd works with g20 countries to quantify their efforts to boost gdp and to achieve national growth strategy objectives.the recipe for reform varies by country, spanning recommendations on creating a more competitive business environment by lowering regulatory barriers to firm entry and exit; helping workers to cope with the rapid turnover of firms and jobs through effective job search assistance, lifelong training programmes and other measures to facilitate the return of laid off workers to quality jobs; and better prepare youth for the labour market of the future with improvements in access to, and outcomes from, basic and vocational education.going for growth 2018 notes that the pace of reforms continues to vary across both countries and policy areas. it points out that governments have tended to concentrate reform efforts in specific policy areas, running the risk of missing potential gains from policy synergies and reform complementarities. improved packaging of reforms would make them easier to implement, maximise the impact on growth and job creation, help avoid unintended spill-over effects across policy areas, and contribute to reduce income inequality.among the highlights in this year’s report:• the pace of reform has, on average across countries, remained similar to the relatively slow pace observed in the past two years. in both advanced and emerging economies, there are few signs of a return to the higher pace of reform seen immediately following the global economic crisis.• notwithstanding the slow pace of reform, some bold actions were taken. notable examples include reforms to strengthen social protection in greece and italy, a long-overdue reform of the labour market in france, significant measures in japan to increase childcare capacity, a goods and services tax in india and a comprehensive tax reform in argentina.• among reforms to boost skills acquisition and innovative capacity, actions to increase the size and efficiency of r&d support have been particularly widespread, with fewer significant reforms in higher education.• the bulk of actions taken to promote business dynamism and knowledge diffusion have focused on strengthening physical and legal infrastructure, as well as on making product market regulation more competition-friendly.• while a high number of actions have been taken to reform social benefits, more reforms are needed to help workers cope with rapid changes in jobs and tasks, including in complementary areas such as active labour market policies and housing policies, to facilitate the job market transition and mobility.further information on going for growth 2018 is available at: http://www.oecd.org/economy/goingforgrowth.htm. detailed country notes are available on oecd and g20 countries.for further information, journalists should contact lawrence speer (+33 6 0149 6891) or the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700)working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
258@Poland: Build on current economic strength to innovate and invest in skills and infrastructure@http://www.oecd.org/economy/poland-build-on-current-economic-strength-to-innovate-and-invest-in-skills-and-infrastructure.htm@19/03/2018 - poland’s economic growth remains strong. rising family benefits and a booming jobs market are lifting household income while poverty rates and inequality are falling, says a new oecd report.in its latest economic survey of poland, the oecd encourages policy-makers to build on the country’s current economic strength and social progress in order to tackle major remaining challenges. to sustain rising living standards poland has to develop its capacity to innovate and invest in skills and infrastructure, as is acknowledged in the government’s strategy for responsible development. the report says that the level of expenditure on research and development, despite recent welcome rises and tax incentives, remains weak. vocational training suffers from limited business engagement which is hindering many of the country’s plentiful small enterprises from modernising and improving productivity.poland is also ageing rapidly. the working age population is projected to decline markedly over the coming decades. the lowering of the retirement age risks increasing poverty among the elderly, particularly women, says the oecd. women often have patchy career paths and their retirement age is now set to remain unusually low. workers should be made aware of the benefits of working longer for their future pension income, the report says.despite efforts to improve childcare, it remains insufficient and expensive, especially in rural areas. more investment in childcare is required as part of a range of measures to help combine work and family life and strengthen the number of women in employment.presenting the survey in warsaw, oecd deputy secretary-general mari kiviniemi said, “poland is in a strong position. a dynamic job market together with the family 500 + programme has helped make economic development more inclusive. many people now benefit from new opportunities and rising incomes.”“the time is ripe to ensure that living standards continue to rise. strengthening innovation, improving infrastructure and investing in skills will be crucial. with rising labour and skills shortages, many employers now realise how important it is to invest in training. the government must seize this opportunity to engage with them.”measures to improve tax compliance have succeeded in shrinking the public deficit despite higher spending on social benefits. but more resources – or shift in how they are used - will be needed to raise spending in priority areas such as public infrastructure, healthcare and higher education and research.limiting reduced vat rates, increasing environmental taxes and giving a stronger role to the progressive personal income tax would raise additional revenue while contributing to more equity and a greener environment.plans to reform higher education and improve research excellence and industry-science co-operation are welcome, the report says.the general health status of poles and access to healthcare are very unequal, while environmental quality is below the average of oecd countries. tax rates on air and water pollution and on co2 emissions are low and many environmentally harmful fuel uses are exempt from taxation. raising environmental taxes would provide stronger incentives to replace ageing coal-intensive equipment with greener alternatives.a clear immigration policy strategy is also needed to better monitor integration of foreigners in line with labour market needs, the protection of their rights and their access to education and training.read the economic survey of poland at http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-poland.htm.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd media office (tel: + 33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

261@Economic expansion offers Israel opportunity to move toward a more inclusive society@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-expansion-offers-israel-opportunity-to-move-toward-a-more-inclusive-society.htm@11/03/2018 - the israeli economy continues to register remarkable performance, with strong growth, low and falling unemployment and sound public finances leading to the 15th consecutive year of economic expansion. further reforms will be needed to drive down inequality and raise living standards for all israelis, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of israel says population growth, strong economic fundamentals and the dynamic high-tech sector are underpinning today’s robust expansion. with the continuation of accommodative monetary policy in a stronger external environment and planned investments in offshore gas fields expected to spur future growth, israel can turn its focus toward new policies that will make its economy both more efficient and more inclusive, the survey said. the survey, presented in jerusalem by oecd acting chief economist alvaro pereira, shai babad, director general of the ministry of finance and yoel naveh, chief economist, projects growth around 3 ½ % over the 2018-19 period. it identifies priorities for future public policy action, including further reforms to education, infrastructure and product markets that can enhance both inclusiveness and productivity.“the israeli economy has grown faster and more consistently than nearly any other in the oecd for the past 15 years,” mr pereira said. “unemployment is at historically low levels, and the rise in people with jobs has had a significant impact on the continuing convergence of living standards in israel with those in the most advanced economies.”“today’s excellent outlook offers israel a unique opportunity to prepare for the challenges of the future, by taking steps to raise productivity, improve social cohesion and guarantee high quality of life for all israelis,” mr pereira said.labour force participation rates, education and skill levels remain low for israeli-arabs and the ultra-orthodox, or haredim jewish groups, contributing to israel’s high poverty rates and low productivity, the survey says. better social and labour market integration of these groups, which will represent half of the population by mid-century, is crucial.reforming product market regulations and improving infrastructure and education should be at the core of future structural reform plans to boost productivity and enhance inclusiveness. enhancing training and education for israeli-arabs and haredim will be essential to improve their economic opportunities and make future growth more sustainable. reforms and more public investment in education would develop their skills, allowing them to find well-paid jobs in high value-added sectors, the survey said.addressing israel’s large infrastructure deficit, especially in public transport, would reduce the country’s considerable road congestion and poor air quality while improving access to the labour market, particularly for disadvantaged groups living in peripheral zones. better infrastructure in disadvantaged areas, especially arab cities, would improve job prospects and well-being.further strengthening product market competition will boost productivity in sheltered sectors.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-israel.htm.for further information, journalists can contact the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
262@Ireland recovering strongly but weak productivity and Brexit cloud outlook@http://www.oecd.org/economy/ireland-recovering-strongly-but-weak-productivity-and-brexit-cloud-outlook.htm@08/03/2018 - the irish economy is recovering robustly. business investment by local firms has picked up, household consumption is reviving while the boost to jobs and a rapidly declining unemployment rate have led to strong wage growth in a number of sectors, says a new oecd report.in its latest economic survey of ireland, the oecd says the expansion is projected to continue over the next two years - albeit at a more sustainable pace (forecast at 2.9% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2019) - but it warns that brexit poses a serious risk to the outlook. it estimates that a trade arrangement between britain and the eu governed by the wto’s most favoured nation rules could reduce irish exports by 20% in sectors such as agriculture and food.such uncertainty makes it vital to further improve public finances to create scope for policies to support the economy in the event of a shock and ensure that the benefits of growth reach everyone.presenting the survey in dublin, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “ireland’s economic performance over recent years has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround that owes much to government efforts to restore dynamism and address the legacies of the crisis, particularly unemployment. but much remains to be done. reviving productivity in ireland’s business sector is the key to boosting future output and wages. efforts also need to ensure that growth is inclusive and sustainable, improving people’s well-being without leaving segments of the population behind.” read the full speech.among its many recommendations, the survey highlights that reviving productivity will be crucial to ensure ireland’s future economic dynamism and to maintain high living standards. local firms compare poorly with foreign-owned multinationals active in ireland, with productivity gaps between them widening. the report argues that unblocking the productivity potential of irish firms will require improving the business environment and encouraging the benefits of new ideas and technology in high performing foreign companies to spill over to local firms. creating the right environment will require reducing regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship. rules surrounding commercial property and legal services are too costly while access to finance for young firms needs to improve. the oecd also recommends improving infrastructure to alleviate emerging bottlenecks. careful evaluation through a more systematic collection of information is required in order to identify investment projects which would have the highest returns in terms of well-being and economic growth.while the survey highlights the improvement in public finances and the reduction of fiscal deficits, it suggests that public debt could be further reduced by broadening the tax base, including by eliminating exemptions and preferential vat rates and raising the property tax yield through more regular revaluations. it also calls attention to the need to continue strengthening the financial sector: despite the fact that non-performing loans (npl) on bank balance sheets have now declined by around 60% from their peak, incentives are needed for banks to further reduce their npl stock.the survey also notes that life satisfaction is relatively high in ireland, but well-being is lower than in many other oecd countries in the areas of housing, health and jobs among young people with low qualifications. house prices and rents are rising strongly. because supply is not keeping up with demand, local councils should be encouraged to rezone underutilised sites for residential use. to promote the efficient use of such land, a broad-based land tax should be introduced. building more social housing would also help tackle the high cost of accommodation and protect those with high debts from falling into poverty.ireland does not have universal coverage for primary healthcare which leads to high costs for those without private insurance. the survey recommends laying out a clear path to the provision of universal access to health and social services.to help tackle low labour market participation among vulnerable groups, the oecd argues for making all social benefits conditional on earnings and not employment status and for withdrawing them more gradually as earnings rise.the oecd and the irish government will this month begin working together on a one-year project to review policies for small and medium-sized enterprises in ireland. it will look in detail at issues such as raising the productivity of local firms, enhancing linkages with foreign multinationals in ireland and rebalancing activity between dublin and the regions.the economic survey of ireland can be downloaded at http://www.oecd.org/ireland/economic-survey-ireland.htm.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd media office (tel: + 33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

264@Further reforms to spur trade and investment key for Brazil’s inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/further-reforms-to-spur-trade-and-investment-key-for-brazil-s-inclusive-growth.htm@"28/02/2018 - brazil is emerging from its long recession and is headed for solid growth in 2018 and 2019 as recent structural reforms start to bear fruit. sustaining this recovery, unleashing brazil’s full economic potential and spreading the benefits fairly will require additional efforts to rein in public spending, increase trade and investment, and further focus social spending on those most in need, according to a new oecd report.the latest oecd economic survey of brazil says that deepening reforms to strengthen institutions, improve business regulation and reap the benefits of tighter integration into the global economy could lift gdp by at least 20% over 15 years, which would boost household incomes and help compensate for the economic drag of a rapidly ageing population. better targeting of welfare spending on the poorest households would be crucial for fostering inclusive growth.“brazil is back on a positive growth path, but there is no time for complacency,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría, presenting the survey in brasilia. “with the demographic dividend now over, getting the economy fully back up to speed will require greater investment, higher productivity and closer integration into the global economy. for this, brazil needs to continue on the path of active structural reform to ensure the sustainability of its fiscal accounts and the inclusiveness of its growth.” (read the speech in full)‌the survey says brazil is foregoing the benefits of integration into the world economy due to a trade policy that has prioritised safeguarding domestic markets over facilitating access to foreign markets. brazil has especially high tariffs on intermediate and capital goods, and non-tariff trade barriers such as local content rules and anti-dumping measures are widespread.lowering trade barriers would make brazilian firms more competitive by allowing them to source inputs at lower prices. this would boost trade volumes and raise productivity and wages. it would also reduce prices for consumers, in particular low-income households.investment, already low compared to other latin american and emerging economies, has declined in both real terms and as a share of gdp in recent years, weighing on the overall economy and adding to existing infrastructure bottlenecks. reversing this trend will require concrete actions to improve infrastructure planning, open up new sources of finance, reduce administrative burdens, simplify taxes, and streamline licencing. continuing to fight corruption with reforms to increase accountability would also help to draw investment and restore citizens’ trust in institutions.on public finances, the survey warns that without a significant reform of mandatory public spending, brazil’s fiscal accounts risk becoming unsustainable. to promote growth that is more inclusive while achieving fiscal targets, a comprehensive pension reform is the top priority for brazil in the short term.the survey also recommends improving the allocation of social spending, much of which benefits middle-class households, to firmly target those most in need. for example, bolsa familia is a highly effective scheme but only accounts for 0.5% of gdp out of the 15% of gdp that goes to social spending. shifting more resources towards this scheme while reforming other transfer programmes would help to decrease inequality and poverty.transfers to private companies, including through tax reductions, have risen strongly in recent years, creating fertile grounds for rent-seeking behaviour and political kick-backs without halting the substantial decline in investment.as brazil works to strengthen public governance and improve accountability for public spending, the oecd is also launching on the occasion of the secretary-general’s visit to brasilia a new 3-year project with the tribunal de contas da união, brazil’s supreme audit institution, aimed at strengthening its capacity to improve the effectiveness and evidence base of policies and programmes in areas such as education, health and security.for further information, journalists are invited to contact catherine bremer in the oecd media office (catherine.bremer@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00).the paris-based oecd

265@Economic Survey of Finland 2018@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-finland.htm@russia’s war of aggression against ukraine has darkened the short-term economic outlook for finland and increased the urgency of transitioning away from fossil energy. the finnish economy is likely to contract over coming quarters, weighed down by high inflation, tightening monetary conditions and curtailment of russian gas supplies to trading partner economies, but to recover in 2024 as these headwinds pass. the war has also worsened public finances, delaying needed consolidation measures to rebuild buffers to cope with future shocks and put public finances on a sustainable path. while finland is on track to meet its gross greenhouse gas emissions abatement objectives, there is scope to reduce abatement costs, notably by replacing inefficient measures by a comprehensive carbon tax in the effort-sharing sector. new measures will also be needed to meet the forestry and other land-use targets, which are very challenging. rebooting innovation ecosystems would help to increase finland’s low productivity growth. this will entail not only increasing r&d spending, but also establishing a mission-oriented innovation policy and a more diversified innovation ecosystem, strengthening synergies between export promotion and innovation, and above all, increasing the supply of skilled workers.

267@Chile should use upturn to address low productivity and high inequality@http://www.oecd.org/economy/chile-should-use-upturn-to-address-low-productivity-and-high-inequality.htm@26/02/2018 - a favourable growth outlook offers chile an opportunity to address its low productivity levels compared to other advanced economies, improve access to quality jobs and take steps to reduce its persistently high inequality, according to a new oecd report.the latest oecd economic survey of chile says that sound macroeconomic management has placed chile on a solid economic footing, and measures implemented by the outgoing administration to make growth more inclusive go in the right direction. it says the incoming administration needs to build on these efforts with further reforms to boost productivity growth, diversify the economy, improve adult skills and get more people into formal long-term jobs that add real value. chile would also benefit from raising public support for research and development and stepping up infrastructure investment, which would spur innovation and competitiveness.“chile is in fine economic health, but the triple challenge of how to raise productivity, improve global competitiveness and reduce inequality remains,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría, presenting the survey in santiago. “the current global economic upswing provides a key opportunity to deepen structural reforms so that chile can achieve its full economic potential, make the most of globalisation and share the fruits more fairly.” (read the speech in full)the oecd projects gdp growth in chile rising to 2.9% in 2018 and 2019 amid robust global economic conditions and firmer copper prices. yet low productivity remains a drag on living standards. while high relative to other latin american countries, output per worker in chile is stuck at half the oecd average, with too many workers employed in activities that generate little added value per work hour. chile’s income inequality gap is also more than 65% wider than the oecd average, with one of the highest ratios between the average income of the wealthiest 10% of its population and that of the poorest 10%. almost a third of chilean workers are in informal or non-permanent jobs, and an oecd survey of adult skills shows that one in two chileans has low literacy skills. the pressure this places on the pension system and living standards will increase with chile’s rapidly ageing population.the survey recommends further measures to lower entry barriers and regulatory complexity to help young firms to innovate, grow and compete. that would also help open up an export market dominated by a handful of conglomerates. only 2% of chilean small and medium-sized enterprises currently participate in international trade.recent education reforms to improve teaching and skills can be built on to improve and expand vocational training and apprenticeships, including better targeted training programmes to those most in need. chile should address the still high share of jobs that are informal or on short-term contracts and expand access to unemployment insurance.continuing the pursuit of an ambitious social agenda is also critical. more can be done to use taxes and transfers for addressing inequality. raising property and environmental taxes, or lowering personal income tax bands, could help finance higher social spending, formal employment subsidies and health insurance support. increasing pension contributions and extending the retirement age, especially for women, could boost gdp per capita over the medium term and help raise the currently low pension replacement rates.for further information, journalists are invited to contact catherine bremer in the oecd media office (+33 603 483456).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
268@Public spending in education and student’s performance in Colombia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/282d9700-en@this paper investigates if higher public spending in education and better teacher qualifications are related to student’s performance, using data from saber 11, a national standardized test conducted by instituto colombiano para la evaluación de la educación. the estimation exploits differences in both policy variables across regions and employs interactions to study if more investment in public education and higher teacher qualifications can help increase average performance and reduce the impact that socioeconomic factors, such as family income, have on student performance. the analysis proposes a model where student performance in mathematics and language are dependent not only on the variables of interest of this paper, but also on economic, social and cultural status, sex and age of students, and school characteristics. the results show that students’ characteristics and their environment, school features and departmental differences in the policy variables explain roughly 20% of the variation in education performance in colombia, a relatively high percentage when compared to those found by other studies focusing on oecd countries and based on pisa. after controlling for students’ and school characteristics, the results show that in colombia, public spending per student and teacher qualifications are positively related to better learning outcomes. for the first one, the results suggest that if all regions reach the level of spending per student of bogota – the region with the highest spending – average math scores can increase by 3.8 to 4.3 points (around 8%), depending on the regions, with the highest improvement for low income students.

282@Improving productivity and job quality of low-skilled workers in the United Kingdom@https://doi.org/10.1787/14dfd584-en@more than a quarter of adults in the united kingdom have low basic skills, which has a negative impact on career prospects, job quality and productivity growth. furthermore, unlike most other countries, young adults do not have stronger basic skills than the generation approaching retirement. the lack of skills development starts at young ages and continues in secondary education; despite a modest reduction in recent years, the educational attainment gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students remains high. the low participation in lifelong learning of low-skilled individuals puts them at risk of falling behind in meeting the changing skill demands of the dynamic labour market. ongoing reforms to the vocational education and training (vet) system and apprenticeship system should have a positive impact on low-skilled productivity, enabling students to gain the necessary basic skills and for workers to find quality jobs. improving the targeting of active labour market policies, and ensuring that the ongoing increases in the national living wage are delivered in a sustainable way will also play an important role in improving job quality and reducing the high rate of youth neither employed or in education or training. policy responses to the rise of non-standard work will also be essential in improving the job quality of the low-skilled.
283@Reducing regional disparities in productivity in the United Kingdom@https://doi.org/10.1787/54293958-en@the united kingdom displays large regional disparities in productivity compared to most other oecd countries, with a large gap between london and most other regions. this holds back aggregate productivity and growth, and contributes to regional differences in living standards. to make the lagging regions more attractive to companies and workers, transport links between and within cities should be improved by increasing infrastructure investment outside london. another policy priority is to improve the local business environment through more spending on innovation and increased support for investment and skills. also, local authorities should have more freedom in setting education and training goals and the land-use planning system has to be more responsive to meet housing needs in cities. the role of subnational government is sub-par relative to the oecd average, but more devolution has recently been introduced in several city-regions. such efforts towards more decentralization need to continue to cover larger parts of the country and involve greater transfers of powers and responsibilities at the local level.
284@France: Improving the efficiency of the health-care system@https://doi.org/10.1787/09e92b30-en@france’s health-care system offers high-quality care. average health outcomes are good, public satisfaction with the health-care system is high, and average household out-of-pocket expenditures are low. as in other oecd countries, technology is expanding possibilities for life extension and quality, and spending is rising steadily, while an ageing population requires substantially more and different services. the main challenges are to promote prevention and cost-efficient behaviour by care providers, tackle the high spending on pharmaceuticals, strengthen the role of health insurers as purchasing agents and secure cost containment. good-quality information and appropriate financing schemes would ensure stronger efficiency incentives. disparities of coverage across social groups and health services suggest paying greater attention to co-ordination between statutory and complementary insurance provision. ongoing reforms to improve prevention and co-ordination among care providers are steps in the right direction. however, progress in the development of capitation-based payment schemes, which can reduce the incentives to increase the number of medical acts and encourage health professionals to spend more time with their patients, and performance-based payment schemes in primary care need to be stepped up to respond to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and curb supplier-induced demand and social disparities in access to care.
285@France: Promoting economic opportunities and well-being in poor neighbourhoods@https://doi.org/10.1787/266e91e1-en@thanks to a highly developed welfare state, poverty is moderate on average in france, but – as in other countries – highly concentrated in some neighbourhoods. their residents face many social disadvantages, including high unemployment and inactivity, schools with many struggling children, often run-down housing and urban infrastructure, and a lack of local enterprises, services and amenities. the government focuses a wide array of policies on these areas to promote better schooling outcomes, employment and local economic activity. urban renewal and public housing policies aim explicitly at promoting social mixing, often presented as an anti-ghetto policy. evidence suggests that targeted investment in transport and housing infrastructure as well as education and training could go a long way to improving economic opportunities and well-being in poor areas. in contrast, special economic zones with tax breaks to attract business to these areas have a mixed track record at best. greater social mixing is difficult to engineer, and it is far from clear if this by itself would improve the lives of the poor. there is a need to better link urban, social and judicial policies favouring alternative sentencing and support for offenders to integrate into society to avoid vicious circles of social disadvantage and crime.

287@Income redistribution through taxes and transfers across OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/bc7569c6-en@this paper produces a comprehensive assessment of income redistribution to the working-age population, covering oecd countries over the last two decades. redistribution is quantified as the relative reduction in market income inequality achieved by personal income taxes, employees’ social security contributions and cash transfers, based on household-level micro data. a detailed decomposition analysis uncovers the respective roles of size, tax progressivity and transfer targeting for overall redistribution, the respective role of various categories of transfers for transfer redistribution; as well as redistribution for various income groups. the paper shows a widespread decline in redistribution across the oecd, both on average and in the majority of countries for which data going back to the mid-1990s are available. this was primarily associated with a decline in cash transfer redistribution while personal income taxes played a less important and more heterogeneous role across countries. in turn, the decline in the redistributive effect of cash transfers reflected a decline in their size and in particular by less redistributive insurance transfers. in some countries, this was mitigated by more redistributive assistance transfers but the resulting increase in the targeting of total transfers was not sufficient to prevent transfer redistribution from declining.
288@The effects of the tax mix on inequality and growth@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/c57eaa14-en@can reforms that shift the balance among different taxes in the revenue mix lastingly influence the overall prosperity of an economy and the distribution of income across households? the present study takes this question to the data, using the experience of 34 oecd countries over 1980-2014 to assess the effects of changes in the tax structure on the long-term level of average output per capita and the distribution of disposable income across households. changing the revenue mix while keeping government size constant typically lift long-term output per capita when they involve cuts in the labour tax wedge below or above average incomes, cuts in corporate income taxes or increases in property taxes. the relative-income effects of revenue-neutral reductions in labour tax wedges are broadly in line with intuition: the relative position of those benefitting from them typically improves. in absolute terms, however, nearly all the income distribution benefits from revenue-neutral reductions in labour tax wedges, be they focused on below or average income earners.

292@Lowering barriers to entrepreneurship and promoting small business growth in South Africa@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d60e254f-en@lowering high levels of unemployment and inequality are amongst the largest challenges facing south africa. more entrepreneurs and thriving small businesses would contribute to inclusive growth. measures of entrepreneurial activity are lower in south africa than in other emerging economies. barriers to entrepreneurship include bureaucratic procedures and licensing, which are also an ongoing burden on small firms. public procurement is being used to overcome the dominance of large incumbents, but so far its net effect on small firms is not clear. an education system that better equipped students with basic skills as well as entrepreneurial skills would grow the pipeline of entrepreneurs. new forms of financing are slowly emerging in a system that is dominated by banks. a better evidence base is crucial for more effective financial and non-financial support programmes to boost start-up rates and small firms’ growth.
293@Export and productivity in global value chains – comparative evidence from Latvia and Estonia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/cd5710c4-en@this paper investigates the effect of export entry on productivity, employment and wages of latvian and estonian firms in the context of global value chain (gvc). like in many countries, exporting firms in latvia and estonia are more productive, larger, pay higher wages and are more capital intensive than non-exporting firms. while this is partly because firms that are originally more productive and have better performances are more likely to enter export, latvian and estonian firms also realise more than 23% and 14% higher labour productivity level as the result of export entry. export entry also increases employment and average wages. gains in productivity and employment are particularly large when firms enter exports that are related to participation in knowledge-intensive activities found in the upstream of gvc. for instance, latvian firms that start exporting intermediate goods or non-transport services (which include knowledge intensive services) enjoy significantly higher productivity gains than those starting to export final goods or transport services. these findings underscore the importance of innovation policies that strengthen firms’ capabilities to supply highly differentiated knowledge-intensive goods and services to gvc.

295@Norway should strengthen its capacity to thrive in a changing world@http://www.oecd.org/economy/norway-should-strengthen-its-capacity-to-thrive-in-a-changing-world.htm@19/12/2017 - the norwegian economy is performing well, despite low oil prices. further reforms will be needed to diversify the economy, improve public spending efficiency and ensure that today’s high levels of income, well-being and equality are passed on to future generations, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of norway points out that the accommodative monetary policy supporting growth has also contributed to house price increases and credit growth. the survey recommends that norway prepares a contingency plan against a possible hard landing in the housing and debt markets, including, as necessary, potential delays to planned monetary policy normalisation and targeted fiscal policy initiatives.the survey, presented in oslo by oecd deputy secretary-general mari kiviniemi and norway’s finance minister siv jensen, projects growth above 2% in 2018 and 2019. it identifies priorities for future public policy action, including reforms to facilitate the transition away from oil-related activities and seize the opportunities offered by globalisation and digitalisation. it proposes measures to improve the efficiency of public spending, in particular by ensuring maximum returns from planned transport infrastructure investment.“it is no secret that norway has among the highest material living standards in the world, both in terms of income and wider measures of inclusiveness and well-being, but this success is not simply the result of being a large oil producer,” ms kiviniemi said. “norway has a very well-managed economy. the challenge going forward is to continue with public policies that ensure inclusive growth for future generations.”to maintain macroeconomic stability, the survey says norway should stick with plans to bring its fiscal rule on budget deficits in line with new expectations of lower returns from the sovereign wealth fund. keeping deficits at or below 3% of the value of the wealth fund, rather than the previous 4%, will require a shift from an expansionary to a neutral fiscal stance. achieving this will require greater efforts to improve public spending efficiency, the survey said.to maintain a successful business sector and facilitate diversification across the economy, the survey recommends norway complete a planned programme of income-tax rate cuts and consider further reductions. it can also continue strengthening competition policy, reduce state stakes in businesses, strengthen routes to recovery in the insolvency regime and replace the taxi-licencing system.improving skills training, notably through greater use of apprenticeships, and taking measures to boost labour force participation, particularly through reforms to sick leave and disability benefits, will allow norway to preserve its high levels of inclusiveness, the survey said.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-norway.htm.for further information, journalists can contact the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

297@The distribution of taxable income and fiscal benefits in Spain: new evidence from personal income tax returns (2002-2011)@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5f8594f0-en@the distribution of taxable income and fiscal benefits in spainthe personal tax system has a large influence on incentives to work, save and invest and hence growth. at the same time it is a key policy lever for income redistribution. this paper analyses how income distribution patterns changed in spain before and after the crisis using the personal income tax samples constructed by the spanish institute of fiscal studies for the period 2002 to 2011. we find that the top and bottom of the income distribution gained the most from the boom period, and the bottom suffered proportionally more in the subsequent bust. although spain's average personal tax rates were above the oecd average, personal tax revenue as a share was below the oecd average. one reason for this is substantial fiscal benefits that significantly reduce total tax received by the government. we examine the distribution of the tax burden, and especially how income deciles benefit from the different fiscal benefits, namely tax exemptions, reductions and tax credits. this reveals that spain's personal income tax system is progressive, especially for labour income, but far less so for capital income. some fiscal benefits, notably the tax credit on maternity, are highly progressive. other fiscal benefits, mainly exemptions and reductions, are regressive. these include the exemptions on renting and on the interest from investing in dwellings and the reduction for contributions to personal pension plans.d31: microeconomics / distribution / personal income, wealth, and their distributions; h23: public economics / taxation, subsidies, and revenue / taxation and subsidies: externalities; redistributive effects; environmental taxes and subsidies; h24: public economics / taxation, subsidies, and revenue / personal income and other nonbusiness taxes and subsidies
298@Boosting productivity in Switzerland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/a29cdbbe-en@swiss gdp per capita stands amongst the top oecd performers. however, to face medium-term challenges productivity developments will be key to allow the country to maintain its enviable position. recent trends have not been favourable, with productivity growth underperforming peer countries. based on macroeconomic analysis and supported by firm-level data, results point to a significant role for competition, innovation, education, firm characteristics and entrepreneurship. the regulatory environment is a crucial element driving productivity and could explain some of the differences across cantons. it is also an important factor for productivity differences across sectors. other issues weighing on switzerland’s future performance include risks from ageing, which can have major consequences on productivity via its influence on economic sectors and also via the age structure and the evolution of productivity through working life. fully utilising the potential of underrepresented population segments would also be beneficial, notably encouraging full-time participation of women and better integrating immigrants. more enterprise creation could be achieved with increased entrepreneurship education, expanded non-bank financing and a reduced regulatory burden. r&d, while an obvious success in switzerland, has apparently not produced commensurate returns in output. diversification, more knowledge sharing, a stronger role for higher education institutions and promotion of start-ups would help reinforce the links from r&d to productivity.this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of switzerland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm).
299@Ensuring a dynamic skills-training and life-long learning system in Switzerland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/438423d9-en@switzerland makes more use of its human resources than most other oecd countries. labour force participation is high and the unemployment rate low for most segments of society. this ensures a high standard of living for most swiss people. nevertheless, productivity growth is relatively slow. while this may in part be attributable to already being an advanced economy, it also means that switzerland cannot be complacent with regard to education and skills. its admirably low youth joblessness suggests that the transition from education to work is functioning soundly. however, there is mounting evidence that as the structure of industry is changing, due to globalisation and digitalisation for instance, vacancies and skills mismatches are spreading. the mix of skills being taught differs from those taught in most other high income oecd countries in which a common secondary school track predominates and the emphasis is on equipping young adults with academic tertiary qualifications. in this context, it is important that the system is flexible enough to respond to shifts in the demand for skills and that workers continue to learn. while the participation of women and immigrants in the economy compares relatively well, more can still be done to improve equity in the accumulation of skills. this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of switzerland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm).
300@The middle income plateau: trap or springboard?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9cba114b-en@"the mixed growth performance of emerging market economies has revived angst about a ""middle-income trap"". however, a forensic review of statistical evidence shows that middle-income countries “escape” to higher income levels more often than both poorer and richer countries. at the same time, growth slowdowns are also more frequent in this group. recent econometric research confirms that the impact of economic policies on gdp growth is greater at middle than at lower and higher income levels. middle-income countries harvest higher returns from structural reforms, but also meet special political economy obstacles in implementing them. the resulting policy divergences imply differences in performance, reflecting notably the uneven expansion of their high-productivity entrepreneurial firms. the paper highlights the channels through which performance improves when obstacles to policy innovations are overcome and reforms are implemented."
301@Capital-embodied technological progress and obsolescence: how do they affect investment behaviour?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/a0cbd544-en@this paper analyses how technological progress embodied in capital goods raises productivity and income, while at the same time it can modify the allocation of consumption, investment and the capital stock. with capital-embodied technological progress, new capital goods become more productive, thus more valuable, but the production capacity of the existing capital goods declines comparatively and they become less valuable. in a dynamic and stochastic general equilibrium framework, a shock to the process of capital-embodied technological progress is shown not to raise investment as much as could be expected, allowing the owners of capital goods mainly to raise consumption instead. as a result, overall capacity taking account of the improvement in the quality of capital goods rises only modestly. the muted investment response might seem very conservative, because the owners of capital could take greater advantage of the sudden acceleration in the improvement of the quality of capital goods which allows them to raise their production capacity more than usually. however, this conservative behaviour is consistent with an anticipated faster decline in the value of capital goods which become quickly obsolete, raising the cost of capital for the owners. finally, this paper analyses the implications of the shock to capital-embodied technological progress coinciding with other shocks, namely, a positive one to the investment accelerator mechanism and a negative one to the risk premium. with deceleration in the quality improvement of capital goods, investors would require higher rates of return while affecting negatively the valuation of the capital stock.

303@Zombie firms and weak productivity: what role for policy?@http://www.oecd.org/economy/zombie-firms-and-weak-productivity-what-role-for-policy.htm@06/12/2017 - weak productivity growth is a major problem afflicting most societies. it curbs growth in incomes and endangers the sustainability of social security systems. an important, but often ignored, source of the productivity slowdown is the increasing prevalence of weakly productive firms and, among them, “zombie firms” – in essence firms that would typically exit or be forced to restructure in a competitive market.a new oecd study shows that the prevalence of “zombie firms” is closely related to weaknesses in the banking system and insolvency regimes. it argues that reviving productivity growth will partly depend on the policies that restore banking health and effectively facilitate the exit or restructuring of weak firms, while simultaneously coping with any social costs that arise from a heightened churning of firms and jobs.the prevalence and productive resources sunk in zombie firms – defined as longstanding firms that have persistent problems meeting their interest payments – have risen since the mid-2000s in a number of oecd countries. in italy, for example, the share of the industry capital stock sunk in zombie firms rose from 7% to 19% between 2007 and 2013. zombie firms represent a drag on productivity growth as they congest markets and divert credit, investment and skills from flowing to more productive and successful firms and contribute to slowing down the diffusion of best practices and new technologies across our economies.new oecd indicators suggest that there is much scope to improve the design of insolvency regimes to accelerate the restructuring or exit of weak firms and thus revive productivity growth. for example, insolvency reforms that reduce barriers to corporate restructuring and the personal cost associated with entrepreneurial failure could translate into a decline in the zombie capital share of at least 9 percentage points in spain, italy or portugal – countries where the zombie capital share stood at 28%, 19% and 16% in 2013, respectively. insolvency reforms have taken place in a number of countries, which are likely to partly achieve some of these gains.zombie firms are more likely to be connected to weak banks, suggesting that zombie congestion partly stems from bank forbearance – i.e. the tendency for weak banks to bet on the resurrection of failing firms. this underscores the importance of a more aggressive policy to resolve non-performing loans, accompanied by complementary reforms to insolvency regimes.distortions in the banking sector also highlight the importance of market-based financing instruments for productivity growth, with the inherent debt bias in corporate tax systems and the lack of venture capital financing emerging as key barriers to technological diffusion.reforms that accelerate corporate restructuring should be coupled with policies to manage the social costs of worker displacement. job search and retraining programs turn out to be effective in returning workers displaced by firm exit to work, particularly in environments where barriers to firm entry are low as this stimulates job creation.media queries on confronting the zombies: policies for productivity revival can be directed to lawrence speer in the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

305@The quantification of structural reforms: extending the framework to emerging market economies@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/f0a6fdcb-en@this paper estimates and quantifies the impact of structural reforms on per capita income for a large set of oecd and non-oecd countries. the findings suggest that the quality of institutions matters to a large extent for economic outcomes. more competition-friendly regulations, as measured by the oecds’ product market regulation (pmr) indicator improve economic outcomes. lower barriers to foreign trade and investment help mfp. lower barriers to entry and less pervasive state control of businesses boost the capital stock and the employment rate. no robust link between labour market regulation and mfp and capital deepening could be established. but looser labour market regulation is found to go hand in hand with higher employment rates. the paper shows that countries at different level of economic development face different policy impacts. furthermore, pmr effects depend on the level of labour market regulations.
306@Aggregate multi-factor productivity: measurement issues in OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5c80faf8-en@this paper analyses for 34 oecd countries the extent to which the calculation of aggregate multi-factor productivity (mfp) is sensitive to alternative parameterisations. the starting point is the definition of mfp used in previous work in the oecd’s economics department (e.g. johansson et al. 2013). they include alternative mfp measures, with human capital included or excluded, with different measures of purchasing power parity (ppp) exchange rates, using time-varying capital depreciation rates and different measures of capital stock and labour input (headcount against hours worked). the main result of the paper is that whether or not human capital is included in mfp makes a significant difference for the level and dynamics of mfp. at the same time, mfp measures are less sensitive to other parameters of the calculation.
307@The fiscal projection framework in long-term scenarios@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/8eddfa18-en@the paper describes the fiscal framework used in long-term economic scenarios, with some emphasis on revisions made since the 2013 vintage of the long-term model. long-term projections for public spending on pensions, health and long-term care are now separate from other primary expenditure and sourced from previous oecd work taking account of population ageing and other cost pressures. other primary expenditure are assumed to remain constant in real terms on a per capita basis, rather than remaining stable as a share of gdp. this difference is important for long-term fiscal projections because government finances are sensitive to the employment rate, whereas expenditure is linked to the total population. a fiscal rule adjusts government revenue to ensure that public debt eventually stabilises as a share of gdp, making government revenue as a share of gdp the preferred indicator of future fiscal pressure.

growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-sees-global-economy-strengthening-but-says-further-policy-action-needed-to-catalyse-the-private-sector-for-stronger-and-more-inclusive-growth.htm@watch the webcast of the press conference28/11/2017 - the world economy has strengthened, with monetary and fiscal stimulus underpinning a broad-based and synchronised improvement in growth rates across most countries, according to the oecd’s latest economic outlook.annual growth of the world economy is projected to improve slightly in 2018, but remains below the pre-crisis period and that of past recoveries. longer-term challenges inhibit stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient economies.the outlook notes persistent effects of prolonged sub-par growth on private sector performance including investment, trade and productivity. employment rates are now above pre-crisis rates in many oecd economies and unemployment is falling, but this has yet to produce solid real wage gains. in the absence of a clear sign of change in underlying trends, growth across the oecd is projected to weaken in 2019.“growth has picked up momentum and the short-term outlook is positive, but there are still clear weaknesses and vulnerabilities,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurria. “there is a need to focus structural and fiscal action on boosting long-term potential as monetary policy support is reduced. countries should implement reform packages that catalyse the private sector to promote productivity, higher wages and more inclusive growth.” [read speech]household and corporate debt in many advanced and emerging market economies is high, creating vulnerabilities and raising questions about the sutainability of growth in the medium term. a special chapter in the economic outlook, on “resilience in a time of high debt,” calls for an integrated policy approach, drawing not only on macroeconomic and macroprudential instruments but also tackling underlying structural issues.a sounder and healthier financial system would reduce the tax bias towards debt, deepen equity markets and improve the design of insolvency regimes. removing tax subsidies for housing and making housing supply more fluid would mitigate the tendency to boom-and-bust cycles.the oecd projects that the global economy will grow by 3.6 percent this year, 3.7 percent in 2018 and 3.6 percent in 2019. the projections reflect slight improvements in the global economy since the previous interim economic outlook in september 2017, but also concerns about long-term momentum.in the united states, growth is estimated at 2.2 percent in 2017, rising to 2.5 percent in 2018, then dropping back to 2.1 percent in 2019.the euro area is projected to grow at a 2.4 percent rate in 2017 and a 2.1 percent pace in 2018 – upward revisions from previous projections driven by stronger growth in key european countries – before slowing to a 1.9 percent pace in 2019.germany is forecast to grow by 2.5 percent in 2017, 2.3 percent in 2018, and 1.9 percent in 2019. france is projected to grow by 1.8 percent over the 2017-18 period and 1.7 percent in 2019, while italy will see a 1.6 percent growth rate this year, a 1.5 percent rate in 2018 and a 1.3 percent rate in 2019. the revised projections reflect stronger-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017, in the context of rising employment, accommodative monetary policy and stronger consumption growth and investment.in the united kingdom, the growth slowdown is expected to continue through 2018, due to continuing uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations around the decision to leave the european union and the impact of higher inflation on household purchasing power. in this context, the uk is projected to grow by 1.5 percent this year, 1.2 percent in 2018 and 1.1 percent in 2019.growth in japan is projected at 1.5 percent for 2017, which is slightly below the forecast in the september 2017 interim economic outlook, and to remain close to 1 percent in 2018 and 2019 as fiscal consolidation resumes and the decline in the working-age population accelerates.the canadian economy is bouncing back to 3 per cent growth rate this year, before slowing to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019 as policy stimulus is withdrawn.expansion in the major emerging market economies is improving, on the back of renewed infrastructure investment in china and recovery from recession in major commodity-exporting economies, but remains softer than in the past..growth in china is projected at 6.8 percent in 2017, 6.6 percent in 2018, and 6.4 percent in 2019, partly reflecting the ongoing rebalancing in china’s growth model.in india, growth is projected at 6.7 percent in 2017 and 7.0 percent in 2018, before picking up to a 7.4 percent rate in 2019, thanks to reforms that are expected to boost investment, productivity and growth.russia is rebounding from recession, and is projected to grow by 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2018 and 1.5 percent in 2019. brazil is also expected to exit recession, with a 0.7 percent growth rate in 2017, 1.9 percent in 2018 and 2.3 percent in 2019.“the global economy is flying low and at risk of financial turbulence,” said oecd chief economist catherine mann. “the only strategy is to pursue an integrated policy approach that will balance actions to boost growth, mitigate risks in the financial sector and improve resilience. we cannot afford to be complacent and assume that today’s economy is as good as it gets – future generations have a right to ask for better.”media queries

309@Labour market and collective bargaining in Iceland: sharing the spoils without spoiling the shares@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/851fc29b-en@iceland has high living standards, low poverty, high inclusiveness and one of the most sustainable pension systems. it is the most highly unionised country in the oecd and, in the past, successful social pacts have protected the lowest paid workers during crises, and on occasion helped fight inflation. nevertheless, iceland experiences recurrent bursts of social tensions and labour unrest that often result in large wage awards, particularly in times of economic boom. iceland is prone to accentuated economic cycles, and the pro-cyclical nature of collective bargaining aggravates these harmful dynamics. social partners often have disagreements over what has been agreed in the past and they can have differing views on the state of the economy. trust among the social partners has been undermined and wage co-ordination is low. there is a large number of unions, many of them very small, and wage demands are often not consistent with macroeconomic stability. labour unrest frequently originates in the public sector as wages lag behind the private sector. fostering trust and increasing wage co-ordination would make collective bargaining more effective and help sustain the benefits of the system for future generations. a technical committee should be established to provide reliable and impartial information to wage negotiators. wage negotiations could start with “wage guidelines” issued by the major labour and employer confederations. state mediator should have greater powers in order to improve wage co-ordination and support the “wage guidelines”. this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of iceland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-iceland.htm).

311@How self-sorting affects migrants’ labour market outcomes@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/77fe9f63-en@assuming that immigrants select destinations according to absolute returns to their observable and unobservable human capital, i present a human capital model of migration accounting for taxes, transfers and limited portability of skills. the model predicts both segmented sorting of migrants to countries with a compressed income distribution, with negative sorting increasing with lower portability and positive sorting increasing with portability. sorting to countries with greater income dispersion increases unambiguously with host-country relevant skills. migrants to countries with compressed incomes will hence be more likely to be either out of work or overqualified and low-paid compared to natives with similar observable skills, and compared to migrants to countries with greater income dispersion. regressions results on data for 16 oecd countries from the oecd survey of adult skills are in line with the model. controlling for observable skills and characteristics, including a literacy test score, immigrants from countries that are less wealthy or further away in geographical and cultural distance are significantly more likely to be either out of work or overqualified and low-paid in high-benefit countries. wage compression, generous transfers and high taxes, typical traits of the so-called “nordic” or “flexicurity” model, may therefore contribute to making immigrant integration more challenging.

313@Reviving productive investment in Estonia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/bb735052-en@since the crisis, estonia has experienced one of the most pronounced declines in the ratio of non-residential investment to gdp in the oecd. in addition, investment in intangible capital has remained well below oecd standards, partly explaining the low innovative capacities of typical estonian firms. uncertainty created by regional geopolitical tensions has played a role but poor investment performance stems from domestic factors too, such as a normalisation after the boom years, the lack of adequate skills and insufficient incentives for risk-taking. improving lifelong learning and maintaining skilled mothers in employment can contribute to reducing shortages in skills needed by investors. restructuring of insolvent firms should be eased to increase credit recovery and redirect capital to the most productive ones. developing alternatives to bank funding can support investment in small and innovative firms. while there is room to improve the quality of infrastructure further, selection and prioritisation of projects should improve. incentives for green investment, in particular to reduce pollution emitted by the oil shale industry and to achieve energy efficiency gains, could be strengthened.this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of estonia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-estonia.htm).
314@Urbanisation and Household Consumption in China@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d8eef6ad-en@this paper focusses on the link between urbanisation and consumption behaviour in china. urbanisation is defined here as rural people moving to cities to work and migrant workers in cities obtaining urban residential status, against the backdrop of government plans to settle 100 million rural dwellers into cities and grant urban residential status to another 100 million migrant workers who already reside in cities. using household data of the china family panel studies dataset, the paper investigates the impact of those residential status changes on household consumption. the results of the analysis suggest that moving up the residential ladder in this way will likely result in increased consumption by almost 30% for both groups of people and thus contribute to rebalancing of the economy. higher incomes and longer times in education are important drivers of this process, while a greater number of children in the family discourages consumption. this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of china (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm).
315@Breaking the shackles: zombie firms, weak banks and depressed restructuring in Europe@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/breaking-the-shackles_0815ce0c-en@this paper explores the connection between “zombie” firms (firms that would typically exit in a competitive market) and bank health and the consequences for aggregate productivity in 11 european countries. controlling for cyclical effects, the results show that zombie firms are more likely to be connected to weak banks, suggesting that the zombie firm problem in europe may at least partly stem from bank forbearance. the increasing survival of zombie firms congests markets and constrains the growth of more productive firms, to the detriment of aggregate productivity growth. our results suggest that around one-third of the impact of zombie congestion on capital misallocation could be directly attributed to bank health and additional analysis suggests that this may partly be due to reduced availability of credit to healthy firms. finally, improvements in bank health are more likely to be associated with a reduction in the prevalence of zombie firms in countries where insolvency regimes do not unduly inhibit corporate restructuring. thus, leveraging the important complementarities between bank strengthening efforts and insolvency regime reform would contribute to breaking the shackles on potential growth in europe.

342@Financial inclusion and women entrepreneurship: evidence from Mexico@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/financial-inclusion-and-women-entrepreneurship_2fbd0f35-en@financial inclusion and women entrepreneurship concern policymakers because of their impact on job creation, economic growth and women empowerment. women in mexico do engage in paid work but many of them work in the informal sector because they lack opportunities to work in the formal sector. moreover, financial exclusion rate in mexico remains the highest amongst oecd countries, affecting women in particular. this paper uses an individual-based panel dataset over the period 2009-2015 to examine the determinants of women entrepreneurship in mexico and to determine the relationship between women entrepreneurship and financial inclusion across informal and formal work and across economic sectors. the results suggest that financial inclusion is positively linked with entrepreneurship and it can open up economic opportunities for women entrepreneurs. various financial access points like banking branches, pos terminals, banking agents, atms and microfinance banks can be a gateway to the use of additional financial services which can allow businesses development through access to credit facilities. however, the positive relationship between women entrepreneurship and financial inclusion does not hold for women entrepreneurs working in the informal sector or women working in the commerce sector, highlighting lower entry barriers, including financial, in the informal sector and problems pertaining to financial illiteracy. results also highlight that the probability of a women being an entrepreneur in the informal sector is higher than in the formal sector. education, age, income, marital status (married or divorced), and income level at the municipality level are amongst other significant determinants which are positively linked with women entrepreneurship. the results also highlight the existence of gender disparity in the status of entrepreneurship across formal and informal work in mexico. on average, women are about 56% less likely to be entrepreneurs in the formal sector and 63% more likely to be entrepreneurs in the informal sector, as compared to men, after taking into account other relevant individual and municipality level characteristics that are important in explaining entrepreneurship.

the world economy has picked up momentum, as expanding investment, employment and trade support synchronised growth across most countries, according to the oecd’s latest interim economic outlook.the pace of expansion is projected to be faster this year than in 2016, with a further uptick expected in 2018, but strong, sustainable, and inclusive medium-term growth is not yet secured.the outlook points out that the recovery of business investment and trade remain too low to sustain healthy productivity growth, while wage growth has been disappointing on average, and not equitable across workers. emerging markets are key for overall global growth - strong future growth depends on deeper reforms.“the short-term outlook is more broad-based and the upturn is promising, but there is no room for complacency,” said oecd chief economist catherine l. mann. “monetary policy should remain accommodative in some economies but with an eye on financial stability so as to remain supportive of further rebalancing towards fiscal and structural initiatives. structural efforts need to be intensified to bolster the nascent investment recovery, to address slow productivity growth and to ensure the recovery yields benefits for all.”“as fiscal policy has eased in many economies, it is crucial that the fiscal room be used to deliver on growth-enhancing and equity-friendly fiscal measures.”the oecd projects that the global economy will grow by 3.5 percent this year and 3.7 percent in 2018, with industrial production and trade picking up and further acceleration in the rebound of technology spending.the projections reflect modest improvements in the global economy since the previous economic outlook in june 2017.growth among the major advanced economies remains on pace. in the united states, growth is estimated at 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.4 percent in 2018, supported by stronger consumer spending and business investment. job creation has remained strong, but the extent to which fiscal easing and regulatory reform may provide an additional boost in 2018 remains uncertain.the euro area is projected to grow at a 2.1 percent rate in 2017 and a 1.9 percent pace in 2018 – upward revisions from previous projections driven by stronger growth in key european countries.germany is forecast to grow by 2.2 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, france by 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent 2018, while italy will see a 1.4 percent growth rate this year and a 1.2 percent rate in 2018. the revised projections reflect stronger-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017, in the context of rising employment rates, accommodative monetary policy and reduced political uncertainty. the upswing is also driven by stronger consumption growth and investment, as well as healthy export growth.in the united kingdom, the previously identified growth slowdown is expected to continue through 2018, while uncertainty remains over the outcome of negotiations around the decision to leave the european union. the unemployment rate has fallen to below 4.5%, but weak productivity and real wage growth persist. the depreciation of the sterling has modestly improved export prospects but also pushed up inflation. in this environment, the uk is projected to grow by 1.6 percent in 2017 and 1 percent in 2018.growth in japan increased in the first half of year, supported by an upturn in public investment and stronger growth in asian markets, and is projected at 1.6 percent for 2017, slightly above the june 2017 economic outlook. rising corporate profits should help strengthen business investment through 2018, but low wage growth and fiscal consolidation are likely to weigh on activity in 2018, when growth is expected at 1.2 percent.canadian growth is projected at 3.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2018.growth in the major emerging market economies has improved overall, helped by a rebound in some commodity producers and public infrastructure investment in china, although growth remains subdued in a number of oil-exporting economies. growth in china is revised upward, to 6.8 percent in 2017 and a more moderate 6.6 percent in 2018, as stimulus measures ease and efforts continue to stabilise corporate debt and rebalance the economy.in india, the transitory effects of demonetisation and of the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) have led to a downward revision in growth projections, to 6.7 percent in 2017 and 7.2 percent in 2018. in the longer run, the gst is expected to boost investment, productivity and growth.russia is rebounding from a recession with higher oil prices and lower interest rates providing a near-term boost to growth, which is projected at around 2 percent in 2017 and 2018. in brazil, monetary easing is helping the gradual recovery and the strong decline in inflation is supporting consumer confidence. growth is projected at 0.6 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, but medium-term growth prospects hinge on delivering reforms - including pension reforms - to ensure fiscal sustainability and enhance productivity growth.the interim economic outlook renews calls on policymakers to enact a rebalancing from monetary to fiscal and structural support for growth and wages. it calls for better use of tax and spending policies to achieve more inclusive growth and says increased structural reform efforts will be needed across all countries to boost productivity, wages and skills.media queries should be directed to the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).

the slovenian economy is rebounding after a long downturn, experiencing stronger growth, declining unemployment, healthier public finances and renewed income convergence with more advanced european economies. further reforms are now needed to increase investment, boost productivity, improve living standards and ensure that all slovenians benefit from inclusive growth, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of slovenia points to strong improvements in the slovenian economy, which is now expected to grow by more than 4½ percent in 2017.[1] it lays out a range of policy options that will help slovenia sustain the current expansion while managing challenges posed by population ageing and an investment slowdown that has limited productivity growth.“having weathered some very tough times, slovenia’s economic situation has improved tremendously,” mr gurría said. “while growth is now exceeding many other european union countries, there is no time for complacency. implementing reform must be a never-ending process, particularly for a small open economy like slovenia, which needs to continuously adapt to changing international circumstances to remain competitive and ensure sustainable and inclusive growth for its people.” read the full speech.the survey says that sustaining the recovery will hinge on addressing labour market bottlenecks, which include persistent long-term unemployment, particularly of low-skilled workers and older workers, as well as skills shortages that prevent more than one-third of all firms from finding sufficient qualified labour.the survey recommends greater investment in programmes to help workers maintain skills or re-skill to gain a foothold on the labour market. new policies will be required to prepare young people for successful careers in competitive, innovative and globally integrated firms, including new and improved training for the jobless and strengthening vocational and university education for the next generation of workers.sustainable public finances will be another key element of ensuring further economic expansion. while the budget deficit and public debt have both declined as a share of gdp, and are currently on downward trajectories, ageing-related spending pressures will continue mounting in the long-term without further action. the survey recommends measures to contain the cost increases in pensions, with the primary focus on increasing the statutory and effective pension ages, as well as in health and long-term care.continued economic prosperity will also require faster productivity increases and greater investment. to achieve this, the survey points out the need for regulatory reform, stronger enforcement of competition, simplified judicial procedures, and lower barriers to entry, particularly in regulated professions.strengthening governance of state-owned enterprises (soes), following through with privatisation plans, notably in competitive activities, and narrowing the list of soes considered strategic should remain a priority, the survey said.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/economic-survey-slovenia.htm.during his visit to ljubljana, the oecd secretary-general met with senior slovenian government officials and members of the national assembly, and presented a second component of oecd country-specific work: the oecd reviews on local job creation – employment and skills strategies in slovenia.the report identifies key actions taken in slovenia to help workers find better quality jobs at the local level, while also stimulating productivity and inclusion. it looks at local activities in the case study regions of drava and south-east slovenia, both of which are investing in skills, training and entrepreneurship activities to increase overall competitiveness and raise the productivity of firms.the oecd points out that uneven implementation capacities across regions in slovenia can hamper job creation and economic development efforts. moving forward, oecd recommendations include:• creating pilot local boards comprised of key municipalities, employers, employment services, and training organisations under an action plan for jobs, and tasking them with coordinating regional employment and economic development policies.• strengthening employer ownership in skills development programmes by providing more work-based training and apprenticeship opportunities, while enabling local governance platforms for employers to advise vocational education and training (vet) providers on their future skills needs.• working closer with employers to improve the use of skills in the workplace through management training programmes and the promotion of high-performance workplace practices (hpwps), which would raise the quality of human capital in slovenia.for further information, journalists can contact the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).
356@Labour market resilience: the role of structural and macroeconomic policies@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d5c950fc-en@this paper provides an overview of labour market resilience in the wake of the great recession of 2008-09 and the role played by macroeconomic and structural policies. the oecd unemployment rate has returned to close to its pre-crisis level, but the unemployment cost of the great recession has nonetheless been very large and long-lasting in many countries. moreover, as the recovery in output has been weak relative to the recovery in employment, labour productivity and wage growth remain low. labour market resilience depends crucially on macroeconomic and labour market policy settings. macroeconomic policies are highly effective in limiting employment declines during economic downturns and preventing that cyclical increases in unemployment become structural. spending on active labour market policies needs to respond strongly to cyclical increases in unemployment to promote a quick return to work in the recovery and preserve the mutual-obligations ethos of activation regimes. overly strict employment protection for regular workers reduces resilience by promoting the use of temporary contracts and slowing job creation in the recovery. co-ordinated collective bargaining systems can promote resilience by facilitating wage and working-time adjustments.

358@Raising skills in Portugal@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/raising-skills-in-portugal_fca87bb4-en@despite significant progress made, improving skills remains one of portugal’s key challenges for raising growth, living standards and well-being. upskilling the adult population remains a priority and lifelong learning activities should focus more on the low skilled. while active labour market policies have increased their training content in recent years, spending per unemployed is still low. a systematic monitoring of the different programmes would allow concentrating resources on the policies that are more effective in raising skills and employment prospects. in the education system, successive increases in compulsory education have not eliminated early school leaving, and a significant share of youth is left without completed secondary education, thus facing poor labour market prospects and a risk of falling into poverty. another challenge for the education system is to reduce the link between learning outcomes and socio-economic backgrounds. this could be achieved by providing earlier and individualised support to students at risk of falling behind, strengthening teachers and principals training and exposure to best practices, and creating incentives to attract the more experienced teachers to disadvantaged schools. vocational education and training (vet) has received less attention than general education until recent years and has suffered from fragmented management. this has curtailed the employment prospects of youth not wishing to pursue tertiary education. establishing a single vet system and reinforcing work-based learning in companies would address this issue. tertiary education has expanded considerably over recent years but could have a stronger focus on labour market needs, including by developing tertiary technical education. enhanced support for business research activities could be coupled with strengthening management skills and the ties between businesses and researchers, for example by creating incentives for academics to cooperate with the private sector. this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of portugal (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-portugal.htm).

361@Improving the efficiency and outcomes of the Slovak health-care system@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/f2b496cd-en@despite improvements over the past few decades, slovak health outcomes remains poor compared with most other oecd countries, even after controlling for differences in per capita income and other social, cultural and lifestyle factors. disparities in access to care and health outcomes between the roma and the rest of the population are large. moreover, the health-care system is a source of general discontent because of high out-of-pocket payments, long waiting lists for some medical services and widely perceived mismanagement of public health-care spending. health-care spending is currently about in line with the country's standard of living. however, improving the efficiency of this sector is key: meeting the rising demand for medical services in the coming decades while containing government spending to maintain sound public finances will be challenging. the most pressing issues to be addressed concern: enhancing the efficiency and quality of primary care; addressing the shortage of nurses and replacing the large number of retiring physicians; modernising hospital infrastructure and management; further tightening control over pharmaceutical and other ancillary spending; developing a comprehensive strategy for long-term care; promoting better care access for the roma population; and improving lifestyles through well-designed public health and disease-prevention policies.
362@The Global Income Distribution for High-Income Countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/65206dc1-en@this paper presents the global income distribution between all individuals living in the developed world. global inequality for the group of high-income countries, as measured by the gini coefficient, stands at 37 in 2013 and has increased by almost 3 gini points since the mid-1990s. this was mainly driven by top 10% incomes growing more than middle and lower incomes and the bottom 10% falling behind. rising inequality within the united states drives almost half of the inequality increase among high-income countries, a combination of a sizeable rise in inequality and a population share around a third in the sample. the broad global middle in high-income countries, located from the 10th to the 90th percentile, experienced strikingly similar disposable income growth, but at a very slow annualised rate around 0.5%. robustness analyses show that this low-growth result is sensitive to declining real incomes in japan and that scaling micro-based incomes to national accounts means, to include in-kind transfers such as healthcare and educational services, lifts measured household income growth substantially. finally, the paper delivers a methodological contribution by decomposing the global growth incidence curve into within- and between-country components, allowing for a more granular assessment of the development than is possible by decomposing inequality indices. the decomposition shows that between-country income differences contributed little to growing inequality in the group of high-income countries.

364@Argentina: Further reforms are needed to boost sustainable and inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/argentina-further-reforms-are-needed-to-boost-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth.htm@27/07/2017 - argentina is making progress in its path to advance its growth agenda. the first oecd multi-dimensional economic survey of argentina underlines the achievements to date of the government’s recent and comprehensive programme of macroeconomic and structural reforms. the oecd notes that the next challenges to be met will be strengthening the pillars of a more productive and inclusive economy, reducing poverty and inequality and improving the well-being of all argentinians.the survey, presented in buenos aires by gabriela ramos, oecd chief of staff and g20 sherpa, and argentina minister of treasury nicolás dujovne, identifies a wide range of next steps for reforms that strengthen people-centred growth, and makes a call so that the necessary reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness of the economy, such as the regulatory framework, product and labour markets reforms, tax policy, infrastructure, innovation, trade policy and financial market are also developed with clear objectives regarding inclusiveness. it made an additional call to ensure further progress on education and skills, and gender. the link between productivity and inclusiveness, which is referred as the nexus at the oecd, could have large pay-offs.aligning argentinian policy settings in these areas with the oecd average could increase gdp per capita by 15% in 10 years, while reforms to align argentina with latin american neighbours chile, colombia and mexico would raise per capita incomes by 8.5% over 10 years, the survey said. provided that policies ensure a people-centred growth, with specific policies that shield poor and vulnerable households from bearing the adjustment costs of change, these policy reforms could deliver substantial benefits for all argentinians.“argentina has undertaken a courageous economic turn-about, improving its attractiveness to domestic and international investment. but what matters most will be delivering greater well-being to the argentine people,” ms ramos said. “inequality, poverty and informality are a drag on growth and should be at the centre-stage of efforts toward a sustainable and inclusive future.”macroeconomic policy should remain directed at ensuring sustainability and sound macroeconomic management, by bringing down inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit and improving access to credit, according to the survey. to improve the efficiency of public spending, argentina can phase-out energy subsidies while protecting the poorest households, rationalise public employment and bring about further cost savings in state-owned enterprises.revenue-neutral tax reforms could include combining lower thresholds where taxpayers begin paying personal income tax with a more progressive rate schedule, phasing out the provincial turnover tax and financial transaction tax, broadening the base of value-added taxes and making social security contributions progressive and better adapted to spur formal employment. an independent central bank with a simple mandate could make monetary policy more effective.the survey highlights the need to strengthen investment and boost productivity, which are the basis for sustainable income gains. continuous reforms allowing greater competition across the economy, by removing barriers to entry and further opening to international trade, will boost productivity and reduce rent-seeking behaviour, thus improving distribution of income.reforms should be accompanied by programs designed to protect the poor and vulnerable and ensure that they see the benefits first-hand. a current focus on strengthening the social safety net and efforts to improve training and education are part of such policies, as is labour market support for affected workers.specific recommendations on the inclusiveness agenda include the call for argentina to focus on improving the distribution of income, which is currently very unequal, with one-third of argentinians currently living in poverty and an additional one-fifth at risk of falling into poverty. supporting this bottom 50% is crucial to make any progress sustainable over time. the report encourages argentina to combine existing poverty alleviation programmes with further efforts to reduce inequalities in the access to quality education, public services and quality jobs and recommends accelerating efforts to address gender gaps.improving education - and in particular reducing inequalities in access to quality education - is key. improved teacher training and more targeted support to disadvantaged students is needed. likewise, expanding pre-primary education and promoting flexible working time arrangements will meet dual goals of improving educational outcomes and boosting female labour force participation, which is low. given that educational attainments of women are on average higher than those of men, this would allow a better use of human capital. extending paternity leave and improving women´s representation at all levels in the public and private sectors through quotas or targets would also contribute to reducing gender gaps in labour force participation.public transfers to reduce inequality and poverty should continue to play an important role, together with stronger efforts to curb labour market informality, which affects one-third of the workforce, who suffer from low wages and no job protection. scaling up training, employment services and incentives for small business development can simultaneously curb informality, boost productivity and improve job quality for all argentinians.the oecd, whose mission is to develop better policies for better lives, is the organization that has documented increased inequalities of income and opportunities, and developed a framework for inclusive growth, in which income and opportunities are better distributed in our populations.an overview of the survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-argentina.htm.for further information, journalists can contact the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).the paris-based organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) is an international organisation that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. it provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to the economic, social and governance challenges they face.the oecd’s 35 members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, latvia, luxembourg, mexico, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, slovak republic, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.three countries – colombia, costa rica and lithuania – have been formally invited to become members of the organisation, and are currently in the process of accession.argentina has been implementing an action plan with the oecd since late-2016 which seeks to support the country’s reform priorities: economic policy, statistics, competition, investment, public management and modernisation of the state, federalism, regional development and multi-level governance, fight against corruption, education and skills and digital economy.further information on oecd cooperation with argentina is available at: http://www.oecd.org/countries/argentina/.
365@South Africa: Find new ways to boost growth and job creation@http://www.oecd.org/economy/south-africa-find-new-ways-to-boost-growth-and-job-creation.htm@24/07/2017 - the south african economy has registered tremendous progress over the past two decades, boosting living standards and lifting millions out of poverty nationwide. further reforms are now necessary, however, to revive economic growth and ensure that all south africans can benefit from it, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of south africa says that wide-ranging structural reforms will be needed to put the economy on a new growth trajectory, boost job creation and improve inclusivity.the survey, presented in pretoria by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and south african minister of finance malusi gigaba, identifies priority areas for future action, including continuing efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability, improve the business environment and deepen regional integration, all of which are critical for inclusive growth and job creation.“south africa has accomplished many great things in the past two decades, but building stronger and more inclusive growth will require bold action from policymakers,” mr gurría said. “ensuring a better future for all south africans will require increased access to higher education, a stronger and fairer labour market, deeper participation in regional markets and a regulatory framework that fosters entrepreneurship and allows small businesses to thrive. many of the necessary reforms will be difficult, but the rewards will be worth the effort.”given the limited scope for monetary or fiscal policy action to boost growth, the survey suggests a range of structural policy reforms. it encourages south africa to open key sectors, including telecommunications, energy, transport and services, to more competition. it also says that moving forward with the planned introduction of a national minimum wage will reduce in-work poverty and inequality. wider development of apprenticeship and internship programmes will also increase the inclusion of youth in the labour market, while streamlining the labour dispute system should increase flexibility and lower barriers to job creation.skills shortages and mismatches remain key bottlenecks to growth and inclusiveness, and access to higher education remains limited. establishing a universal student loan scheme contingent on future earnings, with the participation of banks and backed by government guarantees, is a feasible solution, the survey says. a recent oecd report, getting skills right: south africa, analyses in further detail skills mismatches and explores potential strategies for addressing them.boosting entrepreneurship, which is low in south africa when compared to other emerging economies, and growing small businesses can also be crucial to economic recovery and job creation, according to the survey. the government has taken steps to ease requirements for starting a business, but red tape remains a burden. the quality of the education system and lack of work experience contribute to gaps in entrepreneurial skills. there is scope to broaden the sources of finance and ensure that government policies provide both financial and non-financial support for entrepreneurs and small businesses, the survey says.the oecd points out that while regional integration offers substantial opportunities for both south africa and its neighbours, economic integration in the sub-region has not advanced much. intra-regional trade in the southern african development community (sadc) is only 10% of total trade, compared to about 25% in the asean region or 40% in the european union. better implementation of existing sadc protocols and agreements would advance integration, promote trade and create jobs. reducing non-tariff barriers, by improving customs procedures and simplifying rules of origin, would reduce trade costs in the region. more ambitious and effective infrastructure and investment policies are also needed to improve the inter-connectivity of systems across the region, the survey says.during his visit to pretoria, the oecd secretary-general is meeting with senior south african government officials, business and labour leaders and representatives of civil society.an overview of the economic survey,

366@Economic Survey of Austria 2017@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-austria.htm@austria is set to overcome the covid-19 shock and its economic scars with the help of genuine sanitary, health and economic support policies. the country faces the opportunities and the challenges of two major structural transformations: transition to a net zero emission economy, and the generalisation of more advanced forms of digitalisation. new entries and exits in the business sector, more capital and labour re-allocations, and greater geographic mobility of labour invite new policy measures to boost social cohesion by improving the adaptation of skills to jobs, improving the social protection of free-lance workers, and accelerating the social, economic and educational integration of groups of migrant origin.
367@Austria: Embrace digitalisation to boost growth and inclusiveness@http://www.oecd.org/economy/austria-embrace-digitalisation-to-boost-growth-and-inclusiveness.htm@17/07/2017 - the austrian economy is strengthening, supported by recent tax reform and a pick-up in international trade. with business and household confidence rising and the short-term outlook favourable, policymakers should enact deeper structural reforms that will improve both fiscal sustainability and social cohesion, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of austria discusses ways to build on the cyclical upturn underway and boost potential growth as well as how public policies can foster a speedier transition to digitalisation while ensuring more inclusive labour markets in the digital era.the survey, presented in vienna by oecd deputy secretary-general mari kiviniemi, austrian federal minister for transport, innovation and technology jörg leichtfried and state secretary for diversity, public services and digitalisation muna duzdar, notes that gdp growth has been regaining momentum since 2016. it identifies priorities for strengthening economic fundamentals, boosting business dynamism and a comprehensive approach to ensure equal opportunity in the face of technological change.“austria is in the midst of a remarkable economic upturn, stimulated by a well-timed tax reform and featuring extremely high levels of well-being and strong social and regional cohesion,” ms kiviniemi said. “the positive direction the economy is taking offers a unique opportunity to confront the important challenges that remain. more needs to be done to keep the economy on a strong and inclusive path, boosting job creation, preserving living standards and ensuring that all austrians can seize the opportunities of the digital revolution.”with population ageing expected to put increasing pressure on public finances, the survey recommends austria take measures to maintain long-term sustainability and improve growth, to ensure that public debt remains on a sustainable path.it recommends continued efforts to increase the effective retirement age of both men and women; improving the effectiveness of public spending on education, health care and public administration, coupled with alignment of taxing and spending responsibilities across government layers; and reducing the tax distortions that penalise full-time work and hold back demand for low-skilled labour.to boost potential growth, the survey recommends austria take steps to increase working hours, particularly for women, and boost productivity. it also calls for greater efforts to diversify financing of start-ups and small firms, particularly through venture capital investment and reductions to the tax- and other disincentives for equity investments. the insolvency framework should be reviewed and benchmarked against international best practice. streamlining the licence system for retailers and reducing the number of exclusive rights in professional services would reduce currently high barriers to entry in these sectors.the survey looks closely at austria’s adaptation to the global digital revolution, which has been slower than that seen in best-performing countries, and recommends a range of actions to speed the transition to digitalisation. these include:• establishment of a transparent monitoring system for the implementation of austria’s digital roadmap, with timelines and quantitative targets;• integration of a digital skills plan in the roadmap, directed also at small business owners and managers, that establishes targets for various information and communication technology skills;• facilitate new entries and stimulate competition in broadband services in the context of the broadband plan 2020;• ensure that competition policy responds to changing threats to competition in digital markets, including through international co-operation; and• promote more effective data protection, cyber security and consumer protection, while improving public awareness that responsibility for risk management remains partly with firms and consumers themselves.the survey points out that the digital revolution will increase existing challenges to labour market participation and social inclusion. it recommends policymakers focus on improving equality of opportunity. learning tracks, including life-long learning, should better fit changing labour market requirements for all groups in society, notably the least well-endowed with digital competences such as the elderly and the immigrant workers.to ensure that the benefits of the digital revolution are fairly distributed within firms, and between successful firms and the broader society, the wage settlement and the tax-and-benefit systems, as well as competition and open access regulations, should be adapted to serve this objective. austria’s strong social partnership institutions should continue working with government to address these challenges, the survey said.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-austria.htm. for further information, journalists can contact the oecd berlin centre (+49 30 28 88 35 49), or heino von meyer, (+49 175 434 0424), head of the oecd berlin centre.

international cooperation is now more critical than ever, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said following a g20 leader’s summit marked both by controversy but also advances on a range of policies to tackle global challenges.speaking on the sidelines of the hamburg summit, mr. gurría said collaboration between nations was the key to sustainable and inclusive global growth. “how else can you address global issues such as trade, migration, climate change and the digital economy if it’s not through closer international cooperation?” mr gurría spoke to the summit on issues reflecting just a part of the broad range of support on policy design, evidence-gathering, standard setting and monitoring undertaken by the oecd for the german presidency of the g20, often in association with other international organisations. the oecd contributed to progress achieved in the contentious discussions on climate change and energy. the organisation’s report investing in climate, investing in growth shows how integrating measures to tackle climate change into regular economic policy will have a positive impact on growth.despite the us decision to withdraw from the paris agreement, all 19 other g20 countries reaffirmed and stated as irreversible their commitment to fight climate change.“protecting the environment and fighting climate change can be a source of business, investment, technology and jobs. there is common ground to work together on this crucial endeavour,” mr gurría said to the leaders.the importance of ensuring a rules-based global economy that creates a level playing field for all participants was reaffirmed during the hamburg discussions. the leaders called on the member countries of the global forum on steel excess capacity to fulfil their information-sharing and cooperation commitments by august 2017. as facilitator of the global forum, the oecd said it will support it in producing a report with concrete policy solutions to tackle overcapacity by early november 2017.this, along with the reaffirmation on commitments with due diligence and responsible business conduct, underpinned a key pillar of the german g20 presidency.in their final communiqué, the g20 leaders said they would fight protectionism, including all unfair trade practices, and promote a favourable environment for trade and investment. they called on the oecd, wto, world bank and imf to continue their work to better understand trade impacts and report back to the g20 in 2018. they also recognize the need to ensure that trade and investment work for all and deliver inclusive growth.with the summit taking place against a backdrop of anti-globalisation demonstrations in hamburg, oecd g20 sherpa and chief of staff gabriela ramos said: ""global solutions should deliver for people and redress the increased inequalities of income and opportunities, as well as ensuring respect for global standards. if we want to rebuild trust in the global economy, inclusiveness and sustainability are key. the g20 is the place where the major economies can take action collectively - precisely to fix the system.”she also welcomed the summit’s outcomes related to gender, having been a strong promoter of the commitments made by g20 leaders in brisbane in 2014 to increase women’s participation in the labour force by 25% by 2025.since then, the oecd has continued to contribute to, and encouraged implementation of, the range of initiatives agreed by the g20 to help women fulfill their full potential. they include the eskills4girls initiative to promote opportunities and equal participation in the digital economy, particularly in developing countries, and the women entrepreneurs financing initiative established by world bank with us support.the g20 reaffirmed its commitment to create a globally fair modern international tax system. the oecd’s secretary general’s report to g20 leaders released just ahead of the hamburg summit updated progress in areas such as movement towards automatic exchange of information between tax authorities and implementation of key measures to address tax avoidance by multinationals.calling for improved governance of migration and comprehensive responses to challenges posed by refugees and forced displacement, the leaders asked the oecd in cooperation with the international labour organisation (ilo) , international organisation for migration and(iom) and the unhcr, to provide annual updates on trends and policy challenges.the g20 leaders also addressed health and how to tackle global challenges such as antimicrobial resistance which undermines the effectiveness of antibiotics. working with the world health organisation (who), the food and agriculture organisation (fao) and world organisation for animal health (oie), the oecd drew up a report on ways to boost antimicrobial research and development, while ensuring better usage and affordability of antibiotics.further information on the oecd’s work for the g20 is available at the www.oecd.org/g20; from nicolas pinaud or from the oecd’s media office (tel +33145249700)."

373@Public debt in India: Moving towards a prudent level?@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/public-debt-in-india_853c014a-en@"in relation to gdp, india's public debt and interest payments are high compared with most other emerging economies and rating agencies have put india's sovereign debt at the lowest investment grade. on the other hand, india benefits from strong economic growth and needs to increase spending on social and physical infrastructure to support economic growth and to meet the needs of its fast-growing population. this paper assesses recent fiscal developments in india, discusses the threshold beyond which debt has adverse effects on the economy, quantifies the uncertainties surrounding key macroeconomic variables and the risks of overshooting the debt threshold to define a ""prudent"" debt level. it also provides a debt sustainability analysis. it concludes that under a ""no-policy change"" scenario, the debt-to-gdp ratio will decline gradually to close to the ""prudent"" level by 2040. however, adverse shocks could derail this benign scenario."
374@Insolvency Regimes, Zombie Firms and Capital Reallocation@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/insolvency-regimes-zombie-firms-and-capital-reallocation_5a16beda-en@this paper explores cross-country differences in the design of insolvency regimes and their potential links with two inter-related sources of labour productivity weakness: the survival of “zombie” firms (firms that would typically exit in a competitive market) and capital misallocation. new cross-country policy indicators of insolvency regimes are constructed based on countries’ responses to a recent oecd questionnaire, which aimed to better capture the key design features of insolvency which impact the timely initiation and resolution of insolvency proceedings. according to these metrics, cross-country differences in the design of insolvency regimes are significant. firm level analysis shows that reforms to insolvency regimes which reduce barriers to corporate restructuring and the personal cost associated with entrepreneurial failure may reduce the share of capital sunk in zombie firms. these gains are partly realised via the restructuring of weak firms, which in turn spurs the reallocation of capital to more productive firms. these findings carry strong policy implications, in light of the fact that there is much scope to reform insolvency regimes in many oecd countries and given evidence that rising capital misallocation and the increasing survival of low productivity firms have contributed to the productivity slowdown.
375@The fall in real long-term government bond yields: Disentangling different drivers@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-fall-in-real-long-term-government-bond-yields_cb1ff201-en@this paper contributes to the empirical literature investigating reasons for the fall in real interest rates in advanced economies. it focuses on selected drivers from three broad categories: demographic changes; imbalances between supply of and demand for safe assets; and monetary policy at home and abroad. several country-specific error-correction models are estimated for the g7 countries, starting in the early 1970s. results support the expected relationship with demographic variables. however, this is not corroborated by models with household saving, raising questions about transmission mechanisms of demography. for most countries, there is little robust evidence about the role of proxies of the supply of and demand for government bonds. however, real long-term government bond yields are closely linked with real policy interest rates, with little evidence that real policy interest rates followed secular declines in real potential gdp growth – a proxy of a neutral interest rate. domestic real yields are also affected by foreign real rates, indicating the role of spillovers and common global trends.

377@Taxation and Investment in India@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/taxation-and-investment-in-india_4258e11a-en@business taxation in india is characterised by high effective tax rates, a narrow tax base, and an uncertain tax environment for potential investors. however, india has now begun a process of significant business tax reform, including a staged reduction of the corporate income tax rate and removal of a range of business tax concessions. this paper sets the scene for these (and further) reforms by examining the taxation of business income in india with a particular focus on its impact on the investment climate. the paper calculates corporate effective tax rates to highlight the impact of the tax system on investment incentives, investigates the narrowness of the current tax base and the proposed base-broadening reforms, and examines the degree of investor certainty as to the tax rules and their application. this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of india (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-india.htm)

379@Fighting gender inequality in Sweden@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/fighting-gender-inequality-in-sweden_37b4d789-en@sweden ranks among the best oecd countries in terms of gender equality. women have a high employment rate, outperform men in education and are well represented in government and parliament. nevertheless, without further policy measures, achieving parity is still a distant prospect in several areas. wage differences between genders persist; women are under-represented on private company boards, in senior management positions, in many well-paid and influential professions and among entrepreneurs. hence, there is scope to make further progress on gender equality. the share of the parental leave reserved for each parent should be increased further, as inequality in leave-taking and long parental leaves harm women’s career prospects. fighting stereotypes in education is necessary to improve women’s access to professions where they are under-represented. government programmes need to promote women’s entrepreneurship further. special attention should also be paid to the integration of foreign-born women, whose employment rate is much lower than for their male counterparts.
380@Income, wealth and equal opportunities in Sweden@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/income-wealth-and-equal-opportunities-in-sweden_e900be20-en@sweden is an egalitarian society in international comparison, and has managed to combine equity with economic efficiency. rapidly rising inequality and relative poverty from a historical low in the 1980s partly stem from ageing, changing family structures and migration. living standards increased for all groups, but social benefits rose less than earned income. incomes of newly-arrived immigrants and single mothers trailed the median. bottlenecks in the migrant settlement process are costly to migrants and society, and high entry wages further slow integration. spatial segregation leads to school segregation and potentially reduced social mobility for the least endowed, and rental regulations reduce the scope for settling where job opportunities are the best. fast-growing capital incomes, likely linked to increasing wealth concentration and income shifting, increased inequality. low intergenerational income mobility in the very top of the income distribution is a concern. social benefits should be uprated more systematically and regressive housing-related taxation reformed to strengthen redistribution. migrant settlement and integration need to be better coordinated and adapted to individual starting points. the number of wage subsidies and their administrative complexity should be reduced to ease labour market entry. dysfunctional rental regulations should be reformed to increase mobility and limit spatial segregation. this working paper relates to the 2017 oecd economic survey of sweden (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-sweden.htm).

387@Jobs gap closes but recovery remains uneven@http://www.oecd.org/economy/jobs-gap-closes-but-recovery-remains-uneven.htm@13/06/2017 - the job market continues to improve in the oecd area, with the employment rate finally returning to pre-crisis levels. but people on low and middle incomes have seen their wages stagnate and the share of middle-skilled jobs has fallen, contributing to rising inequality and concerns that top earners are getting a disproportionate share of the gains from economic growth, according to a new oecd report.the oecd employment outlook 2017 finds that the employed share of the population aged 15 to 74 years rose for the third consecutive year. it is expected to reach 61.5% by the end of 2018, above its peak of 60.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007.growing occupational polarisation has also contributed to rising discontent with globalisation, as those with lower or declining wages feel that the benefits from openness and interconnection are being reaped by a few. but the outlook reveals that more than trade integration, job polarisation has been driven by pervasive and skill-biased technological changes. between 1995 and 2015, the middle-skill share of employment fell by 9.5 percentage points in the oecd area, while the shares of high- and low-skill occupations rose by 7.6 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively. “while the jobs gap is closing, many people do not feel the benefits as they are facing stagnant wages and no career prospects: we need an inclusive labour market that reconnects the benefits of our economic model with those who work in it,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría, launching the report in berlin with the german minister for labour and social affairs, andrea nahles. “it is essential to ensure that the benefits of globalisation and growth are widely shared and that our policies are future-proofed to help workers grasp the new opportunities but also respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world of work.” read the full speech click here to see more oecd countriesthe outlook projects that the labour market will continue to improve until at least the end of 2018, with nearly 47 million more people employed than at the end of 2007.unemployment in the oecd area has fallen by 12 million people since peaking in the first quarter of 2010 and youth unemployment is down by 3.8 million. the oecd average unemployment rate is projected to further inch downwards from 6.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 – 38 million unemployed – to 5.7% in at the end of 2018 – 36 million unemployed.but significant challenges persist. the labour market recovery remains highly uneven. the employment rate is likely to be only 1% above its pre-crisis level by the end of 2018. large jobs deficits will persist in some countries, notably in southern europe. even in countries where employment has recovered, wage growth remains subdued.about one-third of overall polarisation in the oecd labour market is due to shifts in jobs from manufacturing to services, with factory workers who have lost their jobs often being forced to take up lower-paid work in the services sector. the remaining two-thirds reflect rising polarisation within industries. these widespread shifts in employment are largely explained by the demand for labour concentrating in high-skilled jobs as well as low-skilled ones with a hollowing of the middle. to address this, governments must help workers build the right skills, and give them the opportunities to upskill and reskill throughout their working lives. countries should also better assess changing skill needs, adapt curricula and guide students towards choices that open up labour market opportunities. in all oecd countries, high skilled workers have two to three times as many opportunities to participate in on-the-job training as their low-skilled counterparts. social protection and labour market policies must also adapt to evolving forms of employment. more than one-half of independent workers in europe are not covered by unemployment benefits. providing social protection for all is key. countries should take steps to ensure entitlements are portable from one job to the next, and make it easier to cumulate contributions from multiple jobs. ‌click here to enlarge the chartthe outlook includes a new scoreboard comparing the labour market performance of countries based on the quantity and quality of employment, as well as the inclusiveness of the job market. it shows that only a few oecd countries do well in all three areas, including nordic countries, germany, the netherlands and switzerland.the report and country notes are available at: http://www.oecd.org/employment/oecd-employment-outlook-19991266.htmfor comment or more information, journalists should contact the oecd media office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).

389@Regulation, institutions and productivity: new macroeconomic evidence from OECD countries@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/regulation-institutions-and-productivity_579ceba4-en@empirical research on the drivers of multi-factor productivity (mfp) is abundant at the firm- and industry level but surprisingly little research has been conducted on the determinants of mfp at the macroeconomic level. in this paper, we seek to understand the drivers of country-level mfp with a special emphasis on product and labour market policies and the quality of institutions. for a panel of oecd countries, we find that anticompetitive product market regulations are associated with lower mfp levels and that higher innovation intensity and greater openness go in tandem with higher mfp. we also find that the impact of product market regulations on mfp may depend on the level of labour market regulations. better institutions, a more business friendly environment and lower barriers to trade and investment amplify the positive impact of r&d spending on mfp. finally, we also show that cross-country mfp variations can be explained to a considerable extent by cross-country variation in labour market regulations, barriers to trade and investment and institutions (including corruption).

391@Regulation, institutions and aggregate investment: new evidence from OECD countries@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/regulation-institutions-and-aggregate-investment_a4ece3c5-en@this paper investigates the relationship linking investment (capital stock) and structural policies. using a panel of 32 oecd countries from 1985 to 2013, we show that more stringent product and labour market regulations are associated with less investment (lower capital stock). the paper also sheds light on the existence of non-linear effects of product and labour market regulation on the capital stock. several alternative testing methods show that the negative influence of product and labour market regulation is considerably stronger at higher levels. the paper uncovers important policy interactions between product and labour market policies. higher levels of product market regulations (covering state control, barriers to entrepreneurship and barriers to trade and investment) tend to amplify the negative relationships between product and labour market regulations and the capital stock. equally important is the finding that the rule of law and the quality of (legal) institutions alters the overall impact of regulations on capital deepening: better institutions reduce the negative effect of more stringent product and labour market regulations on the capital stock, possibly through the reduction of uncertainty as regards the protection of property rights.

[read full transcript]stronger business and consumer confidence, rising industrial production and recovering employment and trade flows will all contribute to an improvement in global gdp growth from 3.0% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2018, according to the outlook.among the major advanced economies, the recovery will continue in the united states, which is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018. the euro area will see steady growth at 1.8% in 2017 and 2018. in japan, growth is projected at 1.4% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. the 35-country oecd area is projected to grow by 2.1% in both 2017 and 2018, according to the outlook.in china, growth is expected to slow to 6.6% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018, while india’s growth rates are expected to strengthen to 7.3% this year and 7.7% in 2018. growth in brazil is expected to turn positive for 2017 before reaching 1.6% in 2018.while the outlook welcomes the pick-up in the global economy, it points out that the forecasts still leave growth rates below both past norms, as well as the pace needed to escape fully from the low-growth trap. it also draws attention to the fact that while some factors could push global growth higher than projected, there are also significant downside risks.on the positive side, the outlook points to the ageing capital stock of firms that may spur stronger-than-expected replacement investment in higher quality capital with more advanced technology. this would improve cyclical conditions and support a revival of investment-intensive global value chains, with knock-on benefits to domestic demand. higher quality capital would also improve productivity and boost potential output.among downside risks, the outlook points to financial risks and vulnerabilities in advanced and emerging economies, high policy uncertainty in many countries and continued weak wage growth.“policymakers cannot be complacent” said oecd chief economist catherine l mann. ”better choices on fiscal, structural and international policies will improve the well-being of a country’s own citizens, but also spill over to improve the outcome for others, raising the probability that the current cyclical upturn will endure and become the foundation for sustained and broad-based improvements in living standards around the world.”a special chapter in the outlook shows that deeper trade integration through global value chains has increased productivity and raised well-being. but it has also led to job losses, particularly for some manufacturing workers, accentuating pressures from technological and demand changes. with manufacturing activities regionally concentrated, this has resulted in some regions falling behind.the outlook suggests that an integrated approach is needed to make globalisation work for all. this must include domestic policies to encourage opportunity, innovation and the creation of new firms, so as to yield economic growth that is both stronger than in the recent past and also more inclusive. at the same time, more effective targeted policies are needed to support people and regions that risk getting left behind. last but not least, countries must work together to fill gaps in the governance of the international economy. this will ensure a more level playing field, as well as more robust and implementable international standards across a range of areas including labour markets, the environment, corporate responsibility, governance and taxation. for more information on the global economic outlook, see: www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm read the full version online: www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-outlook-volume-2017-issue-1_eco_outlook-v2017-1-enjournalists are invited to contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).

396@The challenge of boosting innovation and trade, while achieving inclusiveness@http://www.oecd.org/economy/the-challenge-of-boosting-innovation-and-trade.htm@the recent pick-up in global growth is good news, but a durable return to healthy growth supported by productivity and trade will require stronger political commitment to implement policy packages to make growth more inclusive. the support for governments’ pro-growth structural reforms has been undermined by the prolonged period of stagnating living standards that has affected a large share of the population in many countries and hit some regions particularly hard. growing political headwinds, particularly around globalisation, are clearly one factor contributing to the steady slowdown in the pace of reforms observed since the immediate post-crisis years. yet, the reforms are needed, both to escape the low-growth trap and to prepare for rapid technological changes. the increase in the number of actions taken over the past two years to create jobs–as reported in the oecd annual going for growth report released in march–is an indication of the greater attention that governments are already paying to promoting inclusiveness, in particular with measures to facilitate the labour market integration of youth and low-skilled workers as well as women. such measures are important for the well-being of citizens and winning back their trust. however, achieving inclusive growth on a sustained basis requires addressing the productivity slowdown. the experience from the past two decades has shown that rapid technological advances and greater trade openness do not automatically translate into broad-based productivity and income gains, and they create losers as well as winners. ensuring that progress in technology and knowledge turns into higher and more widespread gains requires that workers, business managers and governments are better equipped to acquire the skills, and adopt the organisational structures and regulatory settings, to keep up with the pace of innovation and benefit from more open economies. while the recipe for reforms varies from country to country, the key ingredients include measures to promote business dynamism and the diffusion of innovation, to help workers cope with the rapid turnover of firms and jobs, and to better prepare youth for the labour market of the future. promoting business dynamism and the diffusion of technology and knowledge is important. to catch up with industry leaders and make the most of new technologies and workers’ skills, lagging firms must be given incentives to make the necessary investment in research and development (r&d), new digital equipment and organisational know-how. governments can help by improving the level and efficiency of public support for private r&d as well as by facilitating the collaboration between research centres (or universities) and industry. creating an environment that encourages firms to innovate also implies promoting the market entry of new firms and the redeployment of resources from poorly performing businesses to high-productivity ones. this is how successful ideas and products can be tested and developed. for this to happen, poorly performing firms should either improve or be allowed to exit the market. since the crisis, the share of non-viable, so called ‘‘zombie’’ firms, has risen from 4% to nearly 6% of total businesses across oecd countries. as they are trapping valuable resources, such firms are lowering productivity by close to 1% in countries where they are most prevalent. facilitating the entry of new firms is also critical. in most countries, the scope for reducing regulatory barriers to firm entry and competition remains substantial, especially in services. in many countries and regions, regulatory fragmentation continues to hinder cross-border competition in services. despite the more rapid pace of change, progress in reforming product market regulation has slowed significantly in recent years, contributing to an increasing gap between high- and low-productivity firms. in fact, the trend decline in business dynamism and the growing survival of low-productivity firms suggest that barriers to firm entry and exit may have risen. beyond product market regulation, other policy factors influence firm turnover and competition. for instance, a sound legal and judicial infrastructure, and robust financial markets that serve the real economy, play an important role. continued efforts to strengthen the rule of law and fight against corruption, improve the governance of state-owned enterprises, increase the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures and the financial sector, or speed-up the resolution of non-performing loans in the banking system: these should all feature highly on reform agendas. to ensure that everyone can benefit from renewed business dynamism and open markets, additional measures are needed to help workers cope with jobs turnover. this is one reason why reform packages are so important for growth to be more inclusive. for example, oecd analysis has shown that spending more public money to help laid-off workers find a new job through work-search assistance and training–so-called active labour market policies (almp)–is far more effective in countries where regulatory barriers to firm entry are low (see chart). this is because job opportunities are more abundant where new firms can enter the market more easily. future advances in digital technologies and the growing importance of knowledge-based capital underscore the need for reforms in education to ensure that young people are prepared for the dynamic labour market of the future and have the right cognitive and non-cognitive skills to cope with technological change. at the same time, more attention should be devoted to the significant share of workers who are either over- or under-skilled for their job. addressing skills mismatch through better vocational education and training systems, as well as adult or lifelong learning programmes, is a priority for most countries. closer relationships between business and educational offerings will better anticipate skills most likely to be in demand, help ensure that job market needs are reflected in educational and professional developments, and enable workers to navigate through the more rapid turnover of firms, jobs, and tasks of the future. reducing barriers to labour mobility, including through reforms of housing market policies and the decoupling of pension and other rights from specific jobs (pension mobility), will also help improve skills matching. packaging reforms to exploit complementarities is key to achieving stronger, more inclusive growth. while encouraging innovation and business dynamism, including through greater market openness, is crucial for achieving healthy and sustained growth, it does not necessarily or automatically go hand-in-hand with inclusiveness. beyond investing in skills development and helping workers cope with turnover of jobs and tasks, the effectiveness of redistribution through tax and transfer policies needs to be strengthened to ensure that the bene fits from technological progress and globalisation are broadly shared. mann, catherine (2016), “the twin challenges of promoting productivity and inclusive growth”, in oecd yearbook, see http://oe.cd/1xo

400@Colombia: Raise productivity and make growth more inclusive@http://www.oecd.org/economy/colombia-raise-productivity-and-make-growth-more-inclusive.htm@25/5/2017 - the colombian economy has been more resilient than other latin american countries to the recent fall in commodities prices, and remains among the strongest in the region. the latest oecd economic survey of colombia finds that while important reforms and current economic policies have helped the country adapt to external shocks, more can be done to boost productivity, improve the business environment and make growth more inclusive.‌the survey, presented in bogota by oecd director of country studies alvaro pereira and colombia’s minister of finance mauricio cardenas, projects gdp will grow by 2.2% in 2017 and 3% in 2018. it identifies priority areas for future action, including reforms to strengthen the quality of education, reduce informality and increase work opportunities for women.“thanks to bold reforms and a solid macroeconomic framework, colombia has been extremely resilient to external headwinds as the commodities boom ended,” mr pereira said. “the challenge going forward is to deliver higher incomes and well-being for all colombians. the peace agreement will certainly boost economic growth and job creation. however, in order to make growth more inclusive, colombia must also achieve better educational outcomes, bring more people into the formal economy, invest in infrastructure for the future and reduce barriers to competition.”the survey says that continuing implementation of the 2016 tax reform will help the economy adjust to lower oil prices and reduce budgetary dependence on oil revenues. raising higher levels of revenue should also help address inequality, by increasing the scope for progressive redistributive policies. further lowering tax burdens on investment and wages can sustain greater formal employment and new infrastructure projects, the survey said.the survey also recommends a range of reforms to boost inclusion, social mobility and living standards. these include further simplifying procedures for company registration and the affiliation of workers to social security, improving active labour market programmes, expanding early childhood education and raising the quality of education and training programmes.greater and more affordable child, elderly and disability care would open the job market to more women. better job opportunities in poorer regions and higher public investment to improve infrastructure and lower costs of trade are required. greater competition in some sectors - such as rail, electricity and roads – and simplifying legal procedures would support private investment and move colombia toward greater productivity and inclusion, the survey said.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible in english and spanish at: http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/economic-survey-colombia.htm.for further information, journalists can contact lawrence speer (+33 6 0149 6891) or the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).the paris-based oecd is an international organisation that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. it provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to the economic, social and governance challenges they face.the oecd’s 35 members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, latvia, luxembourg, mexico, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, slovak republic, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.three countries – colombia, costa rica and lithuania – have been formally invited to become members of the organisation, and are currently in the process of accession.read more on the oecd's work with colombia.

403@Continued slowdown in productivity growth weighs down on living standards@http://www.oecd.org/economy/continued-slowdown-in-productivity-growth-weighs-down-on-living-standards.htm@"18/5/2017 - the slowdown in productivity growth - already underway before the crisis – combined with sluggish investment, continued to undermine rises in economic output and material living standards in recent years in many of the world’s economies, according to a new report released today by the oecd.in its latest compendium of productivity indicators, the oecd also highlights a decoupling between productivity growth and higher real average wages in many countries, resulting in continued declines in labour’s share of national income.in turn, the compendium shows that the contribution of labour utilisation (hours worked per capita) to gdp growth has risen markedly in a number of countries, notably in the united kingdom and the united states. however, rises in labour utilisation reflect two opposing effects: higher employment rates but lower average hours per worker, which points to more part-time working, often in low productivity jobs.higher employment rates are welcome. but the fact that they, rather than increases in labour productivity, have been the most important driver of gdp per capita growth in many economies in recent years is a concern for long-term economic prospects, it adds. the oecd says productivity is ultimately a question of ""working smarter"" - measured by ‘multifactor productivity’ - rather than ""working harder"". it reflects firms’ ability to produce more output by better combining inputs through new ideas, technological innovations, as well as by way of process and organisational innovations, such as new business models.but multi-factor productivity growth (mfp), an important driver of labour productivity growth (measured as gdp per hour worked) in the pre-crisis period, has continued to slow in many economies, and among g7 economies, was negligible in the united kingdom and the united states in the post-crisis period and to a lesser extent in france, as well as in italy, where mfp growth has been negative over the last two decades. however, mfp growth has picked up in canada, germany and japan.the widespread slowdown in labour productivity growth has also been a consequence of weaker investment in machinery and equipment, which slowed across all g7 economies in the post-crisis period. although spending by businesses on intellectual property products - particularly research and development - has been more resilient, this too has slowed from pre-crisis rates.the weakening of labour productivity growth in recent years has been spread broadly across sectors but declines have been sharpest in manufacturing, information and communication services, and in finance and insurance.among oecd countries, labour productivity in manufacturing slowed most markedly in recent years in the czech republic, finland and korea. in business sector services, the slowdown was most notable in estonia, greece, latvia and, to a lesser extent, the united kingdom.labour productivity among the g7 countries was highest in the us where the level of gdp per hour worked was 68.3 us dollars (usd, measured at current purchasing power parities) in 2015, followed by france at 67.5 usd and germany at 66.6 usd. japan, at 45.5 usd, had the lowest level in the g7, below the oecd average of 51.1 usd.in the services sector, small businesses have generally shown stronger productivity growth than large companies since the crisis, although big firms outperformed in terms of the pace of employment growth. in manufacturing, productivity growth has been similar across small and large companies alike.the compendium provides comparative data up to 2015 on all aspects of productivity for each oecd economy including long term productivity trends.other recent oecd work on productivity includes the productivity-inclusiveness nexus and the global forum on productivity.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd media office (tel: + 33 1 45 24 97 00)."
404@A revised approach to productivity convergence in long-term scenarios@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/0b8947e3-en@the paper describes revisions to the trend labour efficiency component of the production function underpinning long-term economic scenarios. the main goal of the revision is to add more policy and institutional determinants in the equation to enrich the scenarios that can be constructed. in the proposed equation, equilibrium trend labour efficiency depends on a broad measure of the quality of institutions and governance (the world’s bank rule of law indicator), human capital (based on average years of schooling attainment), product market regulation (pmr), openness to trade adjusted for country size, the stability of the macroeconomic framework (based on inflation and its variance), income inequality (based on gini coefficients) as well as domestic and global research and development (via accumulated stocks of r&d). apart from the innovation effects, the sizes of the other effects are jointly estimated in a conditional convergence framework with a sample of about 120 countries, without the use of country fixed effects. rule of law and openness are also estimated to influence the speed of convergence toward the long-term equilibrium.

409@Japan: Boost employment and productivity to promote inclusive growth and meet demographic challenges@http://www.oecd.org/economy/japan-boost-employment-and-productivity-to-promote-inclusive-growth-and-meet-demographic-challenges.htm@13/4/2017 - the japanese economy has gained momentum and is creating jobs, according to a new oecd report.the latest oecd economic survey of japan, presented in tokyo byoecd secretary-general angel gurría, says that per capita growth rates in recent years have matched those across the oecd – a major improvement. the survey underlines the key role abenomics has played in the economic revival.‌‌‌but more needs to be done to solidify the expansion and ensure future economic prosperity and well-being against the backdrop of high government debt and a shrinking workforce. the report identifies priority areas for further reforms, including further efforts to increase labour force participation, create more “regular” jobs, especially for women, boost productivity and put public finances on a sustainable track.“abenomics has delivered faster economic growth and job creation,” mr gurría said. “however, meeting japan’s demographic and fiscal challenges will require greater efforts and further reforms, notably to raise productivity, which now lags behind the leading oecd economies. in the labour market, employment opportunities for women must be expanded. achieving stronger and sustainable productivity gains should lead to more inclusive growth that distributes the dividends of increased prosperity fairly across society. ”faced with labour market shortages linked to population ageing, it is important that japan remove obstacles to female employment, notably by increasing the availability of affordable childcare and changing its culture of long working hours through a binding ceiling on overtime work which would improve work-life balance for all workers. this also bodes well with prime minister shinzo abe’s strong emphasis on promoting ‘womenomics’ and his recent efforts on ‘work style’ reforms.breaking down dualism in the labour market – the current segmentation between “regular” and “non-regular” workers, with differing levels of benefits, pay and employment protection - is key to promoting inclusive growth, the survey said.continued increases in health and pension spending linked to population ageing will put upward pressure on government debt, which reached 219% of gdp in 2016, the highest ever recorded in the oecd. ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability requires the implementation of a detailed and credible fiscal plan to put the debt ratio on a downward path. the survey lays out recommendations for controlling public spending and raising additional revenues, notably by gradually raising the consumption tax and increasing environmental taxes.the survey emphasises that increasing productivity can simultaneously help japan address demographic and fiscal challenges and make growth more inclusive. reforms that narrow the wide productivity gaps between manufacturing and service sector firms and those between large companies and smes would help achieve these dual objectives. priorities include improving the personal bankruptcy system to facilitate the exit of non-viable firms, promoting entrepreneurship and increasing japan’s integration in the world economy, the survey said.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/japan/economic-survey-japan.htm.for further information, journalists can contact chika watanabe in the oecd’s tokyo centre or lawrence speer (+33 1 4524 7970) in the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).

411@Improving the allocation and efficiency of public spending in Indonesia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/528dc615-en@indonesia's fiscal position is generally sound and policy making prudent. however, the country still faces important challenges in terms of economic and social development. infrastructure, education, health and social security are all spending areas that the government is trying to improve further, because the nation has yet to converge to the superior outcomes achieved by other countries at a similar level of development. the government's size is small, and raising more revenues will take time, which forces the authorities to get the most out of existing resources and prioritise enhancing the efficiency of public spending. to achieve such an improvement a whole-of-government approach is required, including in the budgeting process and in the establishment of medium-term goals. a key element of indonesia's recent history lies in the tremendous efforts as from the late 1990s to go from a very centralised system of governance towards one with several nested levels of government. according to some metrics it was a success. nonetheless, despite the considerable resources already devoted to decentralisation, there is still ample room for improvement in terms of coordination, transparency, accountability and service provision. more broadly, moving away from spending objectives and adopting performance-based incentives would lift outcomes. at the national level, indonesia would also benefit from scrapping a certain number of inefficient expenditures, such as energy and fertiliser subsidies, and from concentrating on those policies with the highest payoffs, like filling infrastructure gaps and expanding conditional cash transfer schemes. while public employment, especially by some subnational governments, could be streamlined, improving its capacity should be the focus, including for teachers. the fight against corruption should continue by all available means, in particular with a more generalised use of electronic public procurement.
412@Decentralisation to promote regional development in Indonesia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d9cabd0a-en@in 1998 indonesia embarked on an ambitious course of decentralisation. over a period of a few years, facilitated by financial transfers from the central government, responsibility for many public services and administrative tasks were devolved to local authorities. this process is continuing. regional development is now very much in the hands of the four sub-national tiers of government. however, the speed of the devolution means that much is being done without the required accompanying skills, technical capacities, resources and oversight. as a result, while good progress has been made nationally along a number dimensions, outcomes in health, education, infrastructure, corruption and the provision of other social services have not improved as quickly as was hoped, and the variance in results across the regions has been enormous. rather than simply devolving more and more responsibilities to sub-national authorities, the central government needs to take a more strategic view of regional economic development. this includes monitoring the performance of sub-national governments, providing them with technical assistance where needed, encouraging them to emulate the best performers and in the short- to medium-term using grants to direct spending to priority areas. the inter-governmental transfer framework also would benefit from better oversight and a strategic vision. moreover, the perverse incentives it embodies are driving rent-seeking and the fragmentation of local jurisdictions. in the longer term the objective should be tax autonomy and transfers based exclusively on block grants although this should be conditional on adequate oversight and administrative capacities within the sub-national authorities. conflicting and overlapping laws and regulations across levels of government are also inhibiting regional development by obstructing private business development and investment. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm).
413@China: time to focus on financial risks and structural reform@http://www.oecd.org/economy/china-time-to-focus-on-financial-risks-and-structural-reform.htm@21/03/2017 - as the chinese economy matures to a slower but more sustainable growth path, policy efforts need to focus more on efficiency, stability and inclusiveness, according to a new oecd report. the latest oecd economic survey of china projects that the chinese economy will remain the major driver of global growth for the foreseeable future, with per capita gdp on course to almost double by 2020 from 2010 levels. the survey recommends continued efforts to rebalance the economy from investment to consumption and to address key risks including high corporate debt, excess industrial capacity and inflated housing prices.“after decades of breath-taking expansion, the focus should be on making growth more resilient, sustainable and inclusive, and addressing risks to stability,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “china’s economy should now be driven less by physical investment and more by innovation, it should deleverage and it should, above all, become greener.”financial risks are mounting on the back of rising enterprise debt and over-capacity in some sectors, as well as real estate price exuberance. debt owed by non-financial firms in china, encouraged by implicit state guarantees to state-owned enterprises (soes) and public entities, reached 170% of gdp in 2016, the highest level among leading economies. two-thirds of enterprise debt is owed by soes. steps to tackle financial risks should include gradually removing implicit guarantees to soes and restricting leveraged investment in asset markets.the survey also recommends further structural reforms in line with china’s quest to become a “moderately prosperous society” by 2020.the tax and transfer system reduces income inequality less than in other leading economies. for example, many low-income households pay a higher share of income in social contributions than richer ones. the survey suggests basing those contributions on actual income earned, but also broadening the personal income tax base and increasing tax progressivity.vast disparities also exist in access to quality education. the survey argues for increasing public funding for childcare and encouraging the participation of rural children in early childhood education. it also advocates greater central and provincial government social assistance transfers to poorer areas.the survey further recommends that support for research and development, which at present is too concentrated on high-tech industries, be broadened to a wider range of sectors to boost innovation across the economy and maintain sustainable growth. although china ranks first worldwide in terms of patents, streamlining the incentive system and removing regulatory barriers would boost the impact of innovation on productivity.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: www.oecd.org/china/economic-survey-china.htm.for further information, journalists can contact catherine bremer (+33 603 483456) or the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).the paris-based oecd is an international organisation that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. it provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to the economic, social and governance challenges they face.the oecd’s 35 members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, latvia, luxembourg, mexico, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, slovak republic, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.three other countries – colombia, costa rica and lithuania – have been formally invited to become members of the organisation, and are currently in the process of accession.china is one of the oecd’s five key partners, along with brazil, india, indonesia and south africa. key partners contribute to the oecd’s work in a sustained and comprehensive manner. a central element of the key partners programme is the promotion of direct and active participation in the work of the substantive bodies of the organisation. this includes partnerships in oecd bodies, adherence to oecd instruments and integration into oecd statistical reporting and information systems.further information on oecd work with china is available at: www.oecd.org/china/.working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
414@Growth-oriented policy agenda needed to ensure stronger economic recovery with benefits for all workers and households@http://www.oecd.org/economy/growth-oriented-policy-agenda-needed-to-ensure-stronger-economic-recovery-with-benefits-for-all-workers-and-households.htm@17/03/2017 - governments must deploy policy packages that take advantage of the synergies between labour, product and financial market reforms to escape the low-growth trap and ensure that benefits are broadly shared by the vast majority of citizens, according to the oecd’s annual going for growth report. going for growth 2017 offers a comprehensive assessment of policy reforms that can be packaged together to boost long-term growth, improve competitiveness and productivity, create jobs and ensure a more inclusive economy.this year’s edition of going for growth reveals an uptick in policy-maker attention to reforms to lift employment, particularly measures aimed at helping women, young people and low-skilled workers enter and thrive in the labour market, and these have delivered results. however, a worrisome slowdown in reforms that influence labour productivity - such as those in education and innovation policy- is of particular concern in light of the persistent and widespread decline in productivity growth, which is the key to boost wages and living standards.“reversing the prolonged period of stagnating living standards that is affecting a large share of people worldwide will require coherent structural reform strategies and the political will to deploy them,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said. “the vast array of growth and inclusiveness challenges facing advanced and emerging economies call out for a quicker pace and more comprehensive set of reforms. while efforts to promote employment and bring down inequalities are beginning to pay off, governments cannot afford to let up.” (read full speech)going for growth 2017 suggests governments should concentrate reform efforts around packages of policy measures designed to simultaneously target economic and social objectives. the framework for selecting policy priorities laid out in this year’s report considers for the first time inclusiveness as a prime objective, alongside productivity and employment, which are the principal drivers of average income growth.“governments in most countries need reforms to escape the low-growth trap and prepare for coming technological changes, but they must pay better attention to addressing the concerns of those who bear the costs of the reform agenda,” mr gurría said. “putting inclusiveness at the heart of the policy equation is the only appropriate response to the growing political headwinds that have slowed reform.”presenting going for growth with german finance minister wolfgang schäuble ahead of the g20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors taking place in baden baden, mr gurría said that implementing the report’s reform recommendations would help to achieve the g-20 objectives for stronger and more inclusive growth.the going for growth analysis forms the basis of the oecd’s wider contribution to the g20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. the oecd works with g20 countries to quantify their efforts to boost gdp and to achieve national growth strategy objectives.the recipe for reform varies by country, but the ingredients include measures to promote business dynamism and the diffusion of innovation, to help workers to cope with the rapid turnover of firms and jobs, and to better prepare youth for the labour market of the future. these will require improving outcomes and equity in basic education and adult training programmes, exposing businesses to stronger product market competition, including through greater openness to cross-border trade and investment, and beefing-up job search assistance and other active labour market policies to facilitate the return to work in quality jobs of laid-off workers.going for growth 2017 notes that the pace of reforms continues to vary across both countries and policy areas. it points out that governments have tended to concentrate reform efforts in specific policy areas, running the risk of missing potential gains from policy synergies and reform complementarities. improved packaging of reforms would make them easier to implement, maximise the impact on growth and job creation and help reduce income inequality.among the highlights in this year’s report:• the pace of reform has slowed in countries which have been particularly active in the previous two-year period, such as mexico, greece, ireland, portugal, poland and spain, as well as in a number of countries where reform activity was not so intense, including australia, indonesia and slovenia.• reform intensity has increased noticeably in some countries which had not been among the most active reformers, such as belgium, chile, colombia, israel, italy and sweden, as well as in austria, brazil and france.• the slowdown in the pace of reform is principally driven by a decline in reforms tin productivity-related areas. given the importance of productivity gains for long-term living standards, this year’s report puts more emphasis on reform priorities in the areas of education, product market competition and public investment.• many countries have heeded oecd recommendations to boost job creation by lowering labour tax wedges on low-wage workers. individualised job search support and wage subsidies have been stepped up to facilitate the return to work of the long-term unemployed. similarly, the number of reforms aimed at reducing barriers to women working,

415@Spain: Maintain reform momentum to enhance economic recovery and boost inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/spain-maintain-reform-momentum-to-enhance-economic-recovery-and-boost-inclusive-growth.htm@14/03/2017 - the spanish economy is enjoying a robust recovery from a deep recession, with structural reforms contributing to high growth rates and a gradual decline in unemployment. however, further measures to promote innovative business investment and improve skills are needed to both boost productivity and ensure that the benefits of growth reach all spaniards, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of spain says that growth will be above 2% over the 2017-18 period. prudent fiscal management and a continuation of the reform process can ensure a return to sound public finances coupled with strong balanced growth.the survey, presented in madrid by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and spain’s minister of economy, industry and competitiveness luis de guindos, recognises that the economic crisis has resulted in rising levels of poverty and income inequality. it identifies priority areas for making growth more inclusive, including further reductions in unemployment, better poverty reduction policies and improving the quality of jobs through better skills, training and job matching. the report also provides recommendations to make the tax mix more progressive and conducive to job creation, as well as to strengthen the role of the tax transfer system to better address inequalities.“despite a challenging global environment, spain is on the right track”, mr gurría said. “public finances are improving and the important structural reforms implemented over the past years are bearing fruit. while this is an impressive performance, it is critical that the reform momentum be sustained, to surmount the many remaining challenges and ensure a gradual transition to a truly knowledge-based economy. the recovery also needs to be inclusive, addressing inequalities and providing opportunities and improved well-being for all.” (read full speech)to sustainably boost incomes and generate better quality jobs, spain must tackle its chronic problem of low productivity growth by fostering innovative business investment. to do so, the survey recommends enacting policies to better direct bank, capital market and government financing to the needs of new innovative firms. some public r&d funding could be shifted from loans to grants and public financing should be reallocated to early stage finance for firms, where market finance is scarcer. improving the regulatory framework to better promote competition and reforming insolvency laws to allow a faster, less costly recycling of capital is also needed.the survey points out that reducing unemployment remains a top priority. improving skills, extending training programmes and strengthening job placement services, particularly for young people and the long-term unemployed, is critical. better vocational education and training will also have direct impacts on job matching and productivity.the report underscores the limited role that transfers play in reducing inequalities and helping those most in need. increasing the amount and coverage of the regional minimum income support programmes and of cash benefits to families with children could help bring down poverty. so too would tax reform measures like increasing environmental taxes – which would allow increasing revenues that could be used for general policies towards a more inclusive society, while helping curb pollution.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: www.oecd.org/spain/economic-survey-spain.htm.for further information, journalists can contact lawrence speer (+33 6 0149 6891) the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

418@Modest pick-up in global growth but risks and vulnerabilities could derail recovery@http://www.oecd.org/economy/modest-pick-up-in-global-growth-but-risks-and-vulnerabilities-could-derail-recovery.htm@7/3/2017 - global economic growth is expected to pick up modestly next year to around 3.6 % from a projected 3.3% in 2017 but risks of rising protectionism, financial vulnerabilities, potential volatility from divergent interest rate paths and disconnects between market valuations and real activity hang over the outlook, according to the oecd.the projected improvement largely reflects continuing and expected combined fiscal and structural initiatives in the major economies - notably china, canada and the united states - together with a slightly more expansionary stance in the euro area, which could be more ambitious. such policies are needed to catalyse private demand to boost global activity and reduce inequalities.the global economy portrayed by the interim economic outlook remains beset by sub-par gdp growth and high inequality, calling for policy responses that advance inclusive growth in the context of increased economic integration.commenting on the outlook, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “growth is still too weak and its benefits too narrowly focussed to make a real difference to those who have been hit hard by the crisis and who are being left behind. now, more than ever, governments need to take actions that restore people’s confidence while at the same time resisting turning inwards or rolling back many of the advances that have been achieved through greater international co-operation.”the oecd’s interim economic outlook examines some of the many risks that could derail the projected modest upturn in global growth.foremost among these there is the risk of rising protectionism that would hurt global growth and impact the large number of jobs that depends on trade. the rapid growth of private sector credit and the relatively high level of indebtedness is a key risk in a number of emerging markets, above all in china, and housing valuations are a matter of concern in some advanced economies.the strength of financial market valuations appears disconnected to the outlook for the real economy, where the growth of consumption and investment remains subdued. there is also a risk of global financial market tensions as interest rates adjust and diverge across the major economies. the social cost of the crisis and the increased inequalities need to be addressed to make growth more inclusive and to reduce pressures for protectionism and other populist responses.oecd chief economist catherine l. mann said: “the pick-up in growth from countries taking fiscal initiatives is broadly welcome, but we cannot ignore the danger that the recovery gets knocked off track by policy errors or financial risks and vulnerabilities. coherent and committed policy action is needed to simultaneously raise growth rates and improve inclusiveness.”in the united states, domestic demand is set to strengthen, helped by gains in household wealth and a gradual upturn in oil production. gdp growth is expected to pick up to 2.4% this year and 2.8% in 2018, supported by an anticipated fiscal expansion, despite higher long-term interest rates and a stronger dollar.the moderate pace of growth is expected to continue in the euro area but is being held back in some countries by stubbornly high unemployment and underemployment – particularly of youth – as well as by banking sector weakness. gdp for the area as a whole is expected to expand at an annual rate of 1.6% in both 2017 and 2018.in japan, fiscal easing and improvements to women’s labour force participation will help gdp growth pick up this year to 1.2% from 1.0% in 2016. prospects will depend on the extent to which labour-market duality is reduced and wage growth picks up.growth in china is projected to slip further to 6.5% this year and to 6.3% in 2018 as the economy makes a necessary transition away from a reliance on external demand and heavy industry toward domestic consumption and services.higher commodity prices and easing inflation are supporting a recovery from deep recessions in brazil and russia.the oecd says governments need to manage risks, enhance economic resilience and strengthen the environment to boost growth, with improvements in both productivity and inclusiveness. focussing on policies that build structural elements into fiscal initiatives would reduce the burden on monetary policy in the advanced economies and help to boost trade, investment, productivity and wages.the interim economic outlook is available here. for more information, visit www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm.the oecd’s latest monthly composite leading indicator, designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity, also released today, is available here.media queries should be directed to the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

420@Local taxation, land use regulation, and land use: A survey of the evidence@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/52da7c6a-en@this paper surveys the theoretical and empirical research on the relationship between local taxation, land use regulation and land use patterns. the findings can be summarized as follows: 1) in more fiscally decentralized settings, sub-national land use regulation and fiscal policies encourage urban sprawl. in contrast, in more centralized settings, restrictive urban containment policies and a lack of local fiscal incentives for land development tend to generate housing shortages. 2) certain fiscal instruments affect the type and composition of land development, e.g. the share of residential versus commercial development. removing local fiscal incentives for certain property types reduces the amount of land allocated for that type and increases its price. 3) in more decentralized settings, local land use policies aimed at containing or modifying urban growth are ineffective since mobile individuals can circumvent local restrictions by sorting into nearby jurisdictions that offer the preferred combination of land consumption and public services. 4) expanding transportation networks enables households and firms to move to suburban areas, prompting the central city population to shrink and encouraging sprawl, particularly near major highways. 5) in fiscally decentralized settings, sub-urbanization is associated with a growing political power of homeowners. homeowners tend to get fiscal zoning policies enacted – mainly via minimum lot size restrictions – that selectively attract well-off local taxpayers. fiscal zoning thus imposes barriers to local development and raises property values, while at the same time facilitating sprawl. overall, fiscal policy and land use regulation strongly interact, and governments must align those policies carefully to achieve land-use objectives effectively.
421@Boosting productivity in Mexico through integration into Global Value Chains@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/571d5b1f-en@mexico’s structural reforms are already boosting productivity, but more can be done. this paper focuses on issues that have led to the success of the “modern” mexico, and have led to difficulties with the “traditional” mexico. these include the success of global value chains (gvcs) in advancing the trade integration and linkages of key sectors, as well as how competition problems, excessive local regulation, and weak legal institutions have led to misallocation across firms. this paper examines in particular mexico’s successful integration into gvcs. oecd research suggests that gvc participation can bring economic benefits in terms of productivity, diversification and sophistication of production. understanding what drives integration into gvcs provides policy guidance to support a wider integration.
422@Deconstructing income inequality in Costa Rica: an income source decomposition approach@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/77759015-en@despite an improvement in overall macroeconomic performance in costa rica, income inequality has risen and is currently at its maximum historical value. this is in stark contrast with other latin american countries, which have recently made significant progress in reducing inequality. this study analyses the drivers of inequality in costa rica by decomposing the gini coefficient by income source, finding that the main contributor to inequality in costa rica is labour income. in the period 2010-2014, public sector wages made the largest contribution to inequality, in particular wages of qualified workers. within the public sector, wages of those working in public agencies outside central government contributed the most. inequality has also been driven by a large and increasing skills premium in the private sector. workers holding a tertiary degree earn, on average, nearly four times as much as those with only primary education. social programmes, such as non-contributory pensions, do contribute to reduce inequality but their impact is limited given its small share in households’ total income. the analysis also quantifies the marginal effect on inequality of the different income sources, finding that an increase in wages of low qualified workers in the private sector would have the largest marginal impact to reduce inequality. conversely, increases in wages of qualified workers in public and private sector would result in the highest increases in inequality.
423@Economic Survey of Australia 2017@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-australia.htm@the pandemic recession in 2020 was milder than in most other oecd countries, but recent outbreaks have prompted the country to begin transitioning from a zero tolerance to a containment approach to the virus. as the recovery becomes more firmly entrenched, public policy must focus on setting the conditions for another prolonged period of strong and well-distributed growth in living standards. recent efforts to reduce regulatory, administrative and financial barriers for young high potential firms should continue. at the same time, the resilience of the economy to future economic shocks can be supported by rethinking institutional frameworks related to fiscal and monetary policy, ensuring the social safety net is adequate and that the financial sector supports household financial resilience.
424@India: Strong growth has raised incomes and reduced poverty, but challenges remain@http://www.oecd.org/economy/india-strong-growth-has-raised-incomes-and-reduced-poverty-but-challenges-remain.htm@28/02/2017 - the indian economy is expanding at a fast pace, boosting living standards and reducing poverty nationwide. further reforms are now necessary to maintain strong growth and ensure that all indians benefit from it, according to a new report from the oecd.the latest oecd economic survey of india finds that the acceleration of structural reforms and the move toward a rule-based macroeconomic policy framework are sustaining the country’s longstanding rapid economic expansion.the survey, presented in new delhi by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and india’s secretary economic affairs shaktikanta das, hails india’s recent growth rates of more than 7 percent annually as the strongest among g20 countries. it identifies priority areas for future action, including continuing plans to maintain macroeconomic stability and further reduce poverty, additional comprehensive tax reforms and new efforts to boost productivity and reduce disparities between india’s various regions.“india provides a welcome counter-point to a global economy that has been under-performing for years”, mr gurría said. “reforms are historic and are bearing fruit, growth is strong and other macroeconomic indicators are improving. maintaining the reform momentum will be critical to boosting investment and creating the quality jobs needed to ensure strong and inclusive growth for future generations, with all segments of society benefitting from it.” (read his speech)the implementation of the landmark gst (goods and services tax) reform will contribute to making india a more integrated market. by reducing tax cascading, it will boost competitiveness, investment and job creation. the gst reform - designed to be initially revenue-neutral - should be complemented by a reform of income and property taxes, the survey said.the survey points out the need to make income and property taxes more growth-friendly and redistributive. a comprehensive tax reform could help raise revenue to finance much-needed social and physical infrastructure, promote corporate investment, enable more effective redistribution and strengthen the ability of states and municipalities to better respond to local needs, according to the survey.the oecd points out that achieving strong and balanced regional development will also be key to promoting inclusive growth. inequality in income and in access to core public services between states and between rural and urban areas is currently large across india, while rural poverty is pervasive. continuing efforts to improve universal access to core public services is essential.recent changes in india’s federalism model have given states more freedom and incentives to modernise regulations and tailor public policies to local circumstances. ranking states on the ease of doing business is opening a new era of structural reforms at the state level and will help unleash india’s growth potential. further benchmarking among states and strengthening the sharing of best practices, particularly on labour regulations and land laws, could add to the reform momentum.raising living standards in poorer states will require increasing productivity in the agricultural sector. with employment expected to gradually shift away from the agricultural sector, urbanisation will gather pace. thus, better urban infrastructure will be needed to fully exploit cities’ potential for job creation, productivity gains and improving the quality of life.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: www.oecd.org/india/economic-survey-india.htm.for further information, journalists can contact lawrence speer (+33 6 0149 6891) the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).the paris-based oecd is an international organisation that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. it provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to the economic, social and governance challenges they face.the oecd’s 35 members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, latvia, luxembourg, mexico, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, slovak republic, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.three countries – colombia, costa rica and lithuania – have been formally invited to become members of the organisation, and are currently in the process of accession.india is one of the oecd’s five key partners, with brazil, china, indonesia and south africa. key partners contribute to the oecd’s work in a sustained and comprehensive manner. a central element of the key partners programme is the promotion of direct and active participation in the work of the substantive bodies of the organisation. this includes partnerships in oecd bodies, adherence to oecd instruments and integration into oecd statistical reporting and information systems.further information on oecd work with india is available at: www.oecd.org/india/.working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
425@Finance and productivity: A literature review@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/41194fea-en@this paper surveys a broad range of studies and highlights the main findings of the empirical literature regarding business finance and productivity. numerous studies analyse the productivity effects of financial development and frictions. the results suggest: 1) financial development likely has favourable effects on productivity growth; 2) financial frictions that impede the efficient flow of finance can mitigate the positive effects through a variety of channels; and 3) the magnitudes of productivity costs of financial frictions generally appear modest in financially developed economies but are considerably larger in developing economies. the paper also reviews studies of the influence of specific mechanisms on productivity, such as human capital, corporate finance, financial sector efficiency, equity finance and venture capital. some policies that hamper productivity growth include inefficient insolvency regimes that impede exit of low-productivity firms, poorly developed contract monitoring and enforcement systems between banks and firms, collateral constraints that impair resource reallocation and imperfect bank supervisory practices that diminish productive capital reallocation through distorted lending practices.

429@International differences in corporate taxation, foreign direct investment and tax revenue@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/ddd8669b-en@this paper assesses the redistribution of foreign direct investments (fdi) and tax revenues among countries due to multinationals’ response to international differences in corporate tax systems. the paper briefly reviews the literature on the tax sensitivity of fdi and uses a consensus estimate of this sensitivity in combination with bilateral fdi data to compute hypothetical bilateral fdi positions in the absence of tax rate differences. in a second step, tax revenue effects are estimated by assuming a conventional rate of return on investment. for most oecd countries, the effects of tax rate differentials on fdi positions range between -15% and 15% of current fdi positions. the calculated effects of taxes on fdi reflect real investments as well as tax planning behaviours and the methodology cannot distinguish between these two channels. the methodology only captures part of the tax planning activities of multinationals, since some of these activities are not reflected in the size of the fdi positions.
430@International tax planning, competition and market structure@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/e9c35474-en@this paper investigates if tax planning by large multinationals distorts competition in their favour and allows them to crowd out other firms. the competitive implications of tax planning are frequently mentioned in the tax policy debate, but not yet documented empirically to our knowledge. this paper aims to fill this gap. drawing on firm-level data from the orbis database, it compares price-cost mark-up rates of firms with different tax planning opportunities, using several proxy measures of these opportunities, such as links to tax havens. tax-planning multinationals are found to have higher mark-up rates than other firms, even after controlling for other factors influencing mark-ups. however, the direction of causality is difficult to establish since a high mark-up can be a factor encouraging a firm to engage in tax planning. based on a new indicator of industry concentration, the empirical analysis also shows that industries with a strong presence of tax-planning multinationals tend to be more concentrated than other industries, but less so when strong rules against tax planning are in place. overall, the results support the hypothesis that large multinationals use their tax savings to crowd out other firms and ultimately obtain higher mark-ups.
431@Debt and tax planning by multinationals@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/b524037b-en@multinational enterprises (mnes) manipulate the location of their debts to reduce their corporate tax burden. indeed, by locating debts in higher-tax rate countries, mnes can deduct interest payments against a higher tax rate. this paper provides evidence of such manipulation of debt location. the analysis is based on a large sample of firm-level data from the orbis database. by comparing the indebtedness of mne entities with similar characteristics but different debt shifting opportunities, the analysis suggests that a 1 percentage point higher tax rate is associated with 1.3% higher third-party debt. this is a lower bound estimate of debt manipulation, since it excludes the manipulation of internal debt. the analysis also shows that strict rules limiting interest deductibility (e.g. thin capitalisation or interest-to-earnings rules) can reduce debt manipulation. the possibility to locate debts in higher-tax rate countries reduces the effective cost of debt for mne groups. the empirical analysis suggests that this can lead mne groups to increase their overall external indebtedness, compounding the “debt bias” existing in most tax systems.
432@Anti-avoidance rules against international tax planning: A classification@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/1a16e9a4-en@this paper describes the main anti-avoidance rules against international tax planning by multinational enterprises in oecd and g20 countries. building on this information and on previous classification efforts in the literature, a new classification of anti-avoidance strength is compiled. it takes into account five key dimensions of anti-avoidance: (i) transfer price rules and documentation requirements; (ii) rules on interest deductibility such as thin capitalisation and interest-to-earnings rules to prevent the manipulation of debt location; (iii) controlled foreign company (cfc) rules; (iv) general anti-avoidance rules (gaars); and (v) withholding taxes on interest payments, royalties and dividends, taking into account bilateral tax treaties. the classification is based on a simple framework aiming to capture the main features of anti-avoidance rules in a harmonised way across countries, although it inevitably leaves aside certain country-specific characteristics as well as the enforcement of existing rules. the empirical analysis in johansson et al., (2016), which is based on this classification, suggests that strong anti-avoidance rules can reduce profit shifting.
433@Tax planning by multinational firms: Firm-level evidence from a cross-country database@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9ea89b4d-en@this paper exploits firm-level data from the orbis database to assess international tax planning by multinational enterprises (mnes). profit shifting to lower-tax rate countries is measured by comparing the profitability of mne entities having different links to countries with different tax rates and thus different profit shifting opportunities. the paper also considers other aspects of tax planning that have been less documented in the empirical literature, such as the exploitation of mismatches between tax systems and preferential tax regimes, by comparing how profits reported by mne entities are taxed relative to non-multinational entities with similar characteristics. the analysis builds on available unconsolidated financial account data, which, despite its limitations, is considered as the best existing cross-country firm-level data. results are based on a very large sample of firms (1.2 million observations of mne accounts) in 46 oecd and g20 countries and a sophisticated procedure to identify mne groups. they provide robust evidence that mnes shift profits to lower-tax rate countries and that large mnes also exploit mismatches between tax systems and preferential tax treatment to reduce their tax burden. overall, the estimated net tax revenue loss ranges from 4% to 10% of global corporate tax revenues. the empirical analysis also shows that strong “anti-avoidance” rules against tax planning are associated with reduced profit shifting, but also higher compliance costs for firms.
434@Pollution havens? Energy prices are not key drivers of offshoring@http://www.oecd.org/economy/greeneco/pollution-haven-hypothesis.htm@the pollution haven hypothesis argues that firms will seek to avoid the cost of stringent environmental regulations (and high energy prices) by locating production in countries where environmental norms are laxer. in this context, the studies below provide new reassuring evidence on the effect of energy prices on firms’ outward foreign direct investment (fdi). › foreign direct investment and the pollution haven hypothesis – evidence from listed firms (march 2017)higher energy prices are indeed associated with higher outward fdi stock at the firm-level. however, the effects are small with respect to other drivers of fdi. a simulation presented in the figure below shows that the introduction of a significant carbon price (usd 55 per tonne of co ) introduced in one country – resulting in higher energy prices - would not have a major effect on delocalisation of domestic manufacturing activity. so, while technically the results are evidence of the pollution haven hypothesis, they confirm that this effect is unlikely to be large. this conclusion is in line with previous results found in the context of global value chains.the estimates are based on listed firms in 23 oecd countries, spanning across 1995-2011 and 9 manufacturing industries. they are robust to a range of subsamples and various tests.simulated effect of a unilateral carbon tax on firms’ international to total assets rationote: these figures report the simulated effect of the introduction of a carbon tax on the international-to-total assets ratio. we calculate the effect as follows. first, we match a country-year carbon intensity measure for energy use – which accounts for the number of tonnes of co (tco ) emitted per ton of oil equivalent (toe) – with our firms dataset. next, for each firm, we calculate the hypothetic energy price including the carbon tax by: (i) multiplying the carbon intensity measure (tco /toe) with the hypothetical carbon tax (usd/tco ), which provides the carbon price per toe (usd/toe); (ii) adding this carbon price (usd/toe) to the observed price (usd/toe) faced by firms. finally, by multiplying the (log) percentage increase in energy price due to the carbon tax and the estimation results in our paper, we obtain the effect of carbon pricing on the international-to-total asset ratio in percentage points. we consider two scenarios: a tax of usd 15 per tonne of co (panel a) and a tax of usd 55 per tonne of co (panel b).› do environmental policies affect global value chains? a new perspective on the pollution haven hypothesis (march 2016)› environment and trade: do environmental policies affect trade and competitiveness?

436@International tax planning and fixed investment@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/83239540-en@this paper assesses how international tax planning affects real business investment by multinationals. earlier studies have shown that corporate taxes reduce business investment. this paper shows that tax planning multinationals are less sensitive to corporate taxes than other firms in their investment decisions. this is presumably because tax planning multinationals do not face the full tax burden associated with their investments, since they shift part of the resulting profits to lower-tax rate countries. on average across industries, a 5 percentage point corporate tax rate increase is found to reduce investment by 5% in the long term. in industries with a strong presence of multinationals with profit-shifting opportunities, this effect is halved. these results obtained with industry-level data are confirmed by a firm-level analysis. consistently with these results, the investment of tax planning multinationals is found to be more sensitive to taxes when strong rules against tax planning are in place.
437@Innovation, patent location and tax planning by multinationals@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/b08459e5-en@this paper assesses the effect of international differences in taxes on the choice of patent location by multinational enterprises (mnes). the analysis is based on a large sample of patents and firms from the oecd-patstat and oecd-orbis databases over 2004-10. the approach is to compare the number of patent applications of mne entities with different links to other countries and thus different sets of location choices, while controlling for other factors affecting patenting behaviour. the results suggest that lower corporate taxes, either in the form of a lower statutory rate or a preferential intellectual property regime, are associated with more patent applications. both the location of research activities, which is proxied by the location of patent inventors, and the legal ownership of patents are found to be sensitive to corporate taxes. for instance, a 5 percentage point cut in the preferential tax rate on patent income is associated with a 6% increase in patent applications. on average, about two-thirds of the increase comes from patents invented at home and one third from patents invented abroad, but the relative importance of these two effects is likely to vary with the design of the preferential regime and especially the existence of activity requirements. in addition, strong anti-avoidance measures against tax planning are found to reduce patent shifting by mnes.

439@Decoupling of wages from productivity: Macro-level facts@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d4764493-en@over the past two decades, aggregate labour productivity growth in most oecd countries has decoupled from real median compensation growth, implying that raising productivity is no longer sufficient to raise real wages for the typical worker. this paper provides a quantitative description of decoupling in oecd countries over the past two decades, with the results suggesting that it is explained by declines in both labour shares and the ratio of median to average wages (a partial measure of wage inequality). labour shares have declined in about two thirds of the oecd countries covered by the analysis. however, the contribution of labour shares to decoupling is smaller if sectors are excluded for which labour shares are driven by changes in commodity and asset prices or for which labour shares are driven by imputation choices (primary, housing and non-market sectors). the ratio of median to average wages has declined in all but two of the oecd countries covered by the analysis and appears to reflect disproportionate wage growth at the very top of the wage distribution rather than stagnating median wages. the causes for these developments will be analysed in follow-up research.

Zombie Firms and Productivity Performance in OECD Countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/180d80ad-en@this paper explores the extent to which “zombie” firms – defined as old firms that have persistent problems meeting their interest payments – are stifling labour productivity performance. the results show that the prevalence of and resources sunk in zombie firms have risen since the mid-2000s and that the increasing survival of these low productivity firms at the margins of exit congests markets and constrains the growth of more productive firms. controlling for cyclical effects, cross-country analysis shows that within-industries over the period 2003-2013, a higher share of industry capital sunk in zombie firms is associated with lower investment and employment growth of the typical non-zombie firm and less productivity-enhancing capital reallocation. besides limiting the expansion possibilities of healthy incumbent firms, market congestion generated by zombie firms can also create barriers to entry and constrain the post-entry growth of young firms. finally, we link the rise of zombie firms to the decline in oecd potential output growth through two key channels: business investment and multi-factor productivity growth

(read the full speech).the survey highlights the increasing disparities between the highly-productive modern economy in the northern and central regions of mexico and the lower-productivity traditional economy in the south. it lays out a series of new recommendations for maintaining economic resilience, raising productivity and fostering inclusiveness. making fiscal policy more supportive of inclusive growth, notably through more and better social spending, should be a priority. reducing inequalities, via policies to better fight poverty, promote women’s opportunities and foster responsible business practices, is also essential, the survey said.to ensure more inclusive productivity growth, mexico should move forward with reforms to key sectors of the economy, seek to maintain and improve its place in global value chains, lower regulatory barriers, tackle informality and insecurity, and reduce corruption through reforms to governance and legal procedures, the survey said.“our latest survey shows that mexico should make productivity and inclusivity the focus of the government and the different stakeholders,” mr gurría said. “given the wide range of political and economic challenges facing mexico, this course of action is more important than ever.” an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is accessible at: http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/economic-survey-mexico.htm. other oecd reports on mexico to be released this week during the visit of secretary-general gurría look at skills, governance, tourism and how public procurement at pemex is adapting to the opening of the oil sector to competition.the oecd skills strategy diagnostic report: mexico will be available from 18h cet/11h mexico on tuesday 10 january. the report provides a strategic assessment of the national skills system in mexico, assesses how skills are developed, activated and used, and will contribute to the design of effective policies and strategies to meet mexico’s future skill needs.the public procurement review of mexioc's pemex: adapting to change in the oil industry will be available from 18h cet/11h mexico on wednesday 11 january (in spanish). the review finds that more can be done to professionalise procurement procedures at pemex and introduce more competitive tenders. the oecd integrity review of mexico: taking a stronger stance against corruption will be available from 01h cet thursday 12 january/18h mexico on wednesday 11 january (in spanish). it examines mexico’s recent anti-corruption reforms and recommends the strengthening of enforcement and accountability mechanisms and the integration of anti-corruption policies into areas such as open government, education and security to improve competitiveness, productivity and trust in government. the tourism policy review of mexico, which finds that there is significant untapped potential to create inclusive growth in mexico through new tourism models focused on local development, will be available from 19h cet/12h mexico on thursday 12 january. for further information, journalists are invited to contact carolina ziehl (+52 559 138 6235) in the oecd’s mexico city centre or the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700).

447@Enhancing skills to boost growth in Hungary@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/ba9ac297-en@skill requirements in the labour market have significantly changed over the past two decades. the restructuring of the economy is making the labour market increasingly knowledge-based. the education system has reacted to this structural change, but as the pace has been relatively slow, many graduates remain without adequate skills and insufficiently prepared to apply knowledge in unfamiliar settings. moreover, strong selectivity early in the education system reinforces student’s socio‑economic background, leading to an excess of low skilled workers with poor labour market prospects. this contributes to persistently low employment rates and low productivity gains, slowing down the income convergence process. the education system needs to improve learning outcomes by better aligning student qualifications with labour market needs. improving overall educational outcomes would also make the education system more equitable and inclusive. bolstering the supply of skills requires lifelong learning and improving the access to labour market to those who have left the education system without proper skills. in return, this will also increase “on‑the‑job” training, which is a key driver of acquiring competences after graduation. in addition, mobilising untapped skill resources, particular educated younger women, would raise employment, which is needed to confront the labour market problem arising from population ageing.

450@Trends in productivity and sources of productivity growth in Slovenia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/a6691907-en@slovenia’s living standards measured in gdp per capita are currently some 20% below the eu15 average and have not yet reached their pre-crisis level. given that most of this gap comes from differences in labour productivity, the paper looks at productivity trends and sources of productivity growth over past two decades. the largest labour productivity lags are in agriculture and mining and utilities, but lags are also present in services sectors such as information and communication activities, financial and insurance activities and professional services. the importance of the high and medium high technology manufacturing has risen in the last two decades, and their share in total manufacturing value added is relatively high in slovenia. growth accounting shows that total factor productivity (tfp) and physical capital were the main sources of economic growth before the crisis in slovenia, while the contribution of human capital was low. with the crisis, however, the gdp growth turned highly negative due to large drops in tfp and the labour input contribution. the contribution from physical capital was also reduced, reflecting subdued investment activity. slovenia has a high level of state control in the economy and low foreign direct investment (fdi). using two different panel datasets – one spanning the oecd countries and another spanning slovenia's economic activities - we find that improving both measures could significantly raise productivity.

452@Rebalancing Turkey’s growth by improving resource allocation and productivity in manufacturing@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/c35af920-en@turkey’s manufacturing sector has expanded considerably but not efficiently and competitively enough. this paper documents the drivers of its recent growth and diversification, and the factors that have held it back. it documents its segmentation and the outsized tail of poorly performing firms, which undermines aggregate productivity growth. low productivity eases job creation in the short term, but undermines it in the long run and holds back improvements in living standards because of competitiveness losses. a core of well-performing firms (“frontier firms”) is not growing at full potential because of shortcomings in the policy framework. intermediary (“follower”) firms sustain competition and deliver jobs, but tend to fall behind in productivity. lower productivity units (“laggards”), which employ a large share of the low-skilled majority of the working age population, survive mostly thanks to the incomplete enforcement of rules and regulations. the resulting stalemate requires a coherent strategy of “systemic upgrading” of the business environment. this would enable all firms to operate in compliance with the law and on a level-playing field, under supportive regulations, taxation and innovation incentives. all firms could then achieve stronger productivity gains and the most promising firms could grow faster. at the same time, a credible flexicurity system needs to be put in place that facilitates adjustment in the labour market while protecting those affected by structural change.
453@Reaping the benefits of global value chains in Turkey@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d054af64-en@despite major progress, turkey still lags behind most comparable countries in terms of exported value added per capita. its remarkable economic performance over the past 15 years has not been sufficiently backed by gains in export market shares, in particular when measured in value added terms. while turkey incorporates an increasing share of foreign value added in its own exports, its capacity to provide intermediate inputs to other countries’ exports is still limited. this paper argues that turkey’s participation in global value chains remains below potential owing to institutional features that hamper efficient allocation of capital and labour, obstacles inherent in bilateral trade agreements and entry regulations, underdeveloped human capital and insufficient investment in innovation, r&d and knowledge-based capital. progress along these dimensions would strengthen turkey’s backward and forward trade linkages and contribute to rebalancing its growth model. the adjustment process towards a more export-oriented economy operating on a level playing field needs to be flanked by dedicated industrial, social and environmental policies to alleviate adverse consequences on displaced firms and workers and the ecosystem.
454@Incentivising lending to SMEs with the Funding for Lending Scheme: some evidence from bank-level data in the United Kingdom@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/a4352865-en@this study explores the effectiveness of the incentive mechanisms embedded within the uk’s funding for lending scheme (fls) for banks’ to expand their supply of lending to medium sized enterprises (smes). the fls was announced by the bank of england and hm treasury in june 2012, with the aim of improving the supply of credit to the uk real economy. despite the prevailing low level of risk-free interest rates, uk banks’ funding costs were elevated at the time of the scheme's introduction, and the intention was to provide lenders with a stable source of lower-cost funding to support credit provision to the real economy. the scheme’s design built in direct incentives for banks to support lending to the real economy, by linking both the price and quantity of funding available through the scheme to their lending performance. this paper looks for evidence of the effectiveness of these incentives, exploiting a modification of the scheme’s design for its extension in april 2013 to help identify changes in credit supply from credit demand. specifically, the change sharpened incentives to lend to smes, relative to larger ones. this facilitates using a difference-in-difference approach, exploiting bank-level data on uk banking groups, to look for a direct impact of incentives on credit supply, considering larger companies as a control group. on the basis of the available dataset, it is not possible to identify that this change in the incentive structure of the fls directly boosted loan growth to smes, relative to large firms, between the extension of the scheme and the end of 2013. the results seem robust to using different metrics of credit supply. however, the dataset is unavoidably small, both in terms of number of lenders covered and the length of the period after the modification of the design. more generally, reductions in lenders’ market funding costs since the fls’ introduction may have lessened banks’ incentives to use draw on the scheme, and so the impact of incentives within it.

461@Make better use of fiscal initiatives to escape low-growth trap, OECD says in latest Global Economic Outlook@http://www.oecd.org/economy/make-better-use-of-fiscal-initiatives-to-escape-low-growth-trap-oecd-says-in-latest-global-economic-outlook.htm@28/11/2016 - expansionary fiscal initiatives and maintaining trade openness are needed to push the global economy out of today’s low-growth trap, according to the oecd’s latest global economic outlook.“the global economy has the prospect of modestly higher growth, after five years of disappointingly weak outcomes,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said while launching the outlook. “in light of the current context of low interest rates, policymakers have a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels. we urge them to do so,” mr gurría said. the outlook projects that well targeted public spending initiatives could catalyse private economic activity and help to get the global economy out of the low-growth trap. the ongoing or projected shift in the fiscal stance in a number of major economies accounts for much of the modest increase in global growth to 3.3% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018.among the major advanced economies, activity is expected to accelerate in the united states, due to an assumed easing of fiscal policy, with the economy projected to grow by 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018. the euro area will grow at a 1.6% rate in 2017 and by 1.7% in 2018. in japan, growth is projected at 1% in 2017 and 0.8% in 2018. the 35-country oecd area is projected to grow by 2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, according to the outlook.with rebalancing continuing in china, growth is expected to continue drifting lower, to 6.4% in 2017 and 6.1% in 2018. india’s growth rates are expected to hover above 7.5% over the 2017-18 period, but many emerging market economies will continue to grow at a more sluggish pace. the deep recession in brazil is expected to end in 2017, after which the economy will grow at a 1.2% rate in 2018.the outlook draws attention to conditions that create a “window of opportunity” for new fiscal initiatives, as extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy has led to very low interest rates and created fiscal space. a targeted annual increase in public spending of ½ percent of gdp could be financed for several years in most countries without increasing the debt-to-gdp ratio in the medium term. combining this initiative with structural reforms, and acting collectively across countries, would boost the impact, according to the outlook.“this is not a blank cheque for governments,” mr gurría said. “the oecd is calling for fiscal policy to be used more wisely, with spending targeted at areas that boost growth, like high-quality infrastructure investment, innovation, education and skills, which also make growth more inclusive.” (read the full speech)the outlook identifies a number of financial risks where exchange rate and capital flow volatility coupled with pricing distortions are exposing the vulnerability of corporate balance sheets, particularly in emerging markets, and challenging bank profitability and the long-term stability of pension schemes in advanced economies.an increase in protectionism could risk impairing already weak growth in global trade.“protectionism and the inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the positive effects of proposed fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth,” said oecd chief economist catherine l. mann. “it would also likely raise prices, harm living standards and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position. trade protectionism may shelter some jobs, but it will worsen prospects and lower well-being for many others.”the outlook calls on governments to avoid protectionist policies and encourages them instead to implement structural policy packages that create more job opportunities, increase business dynamism and promote successful reallocation, ensuring that the gains from trade are better shared by all.for more information on the economic outlook, see: www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm.an embeddable data visualisation for this publication is available at: www.compareyourcountry.org/oecd-economic-outlook?lg=en. please use the ‘+share/embed’ button to customize this tool for your country and language and to generate the embed code for your website. journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 97 00).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

472@How do product market regulations affect workers? Evidence from the network industries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5167d865-en@knowing who gains and loses from regulatory reform is important for understanding the political economy of reform. using micro-level data from 26 countries, this paper studies how regulatory reform of network industries, a policy priority in many advanced economies, influences the labour market situation of workers in network industries. estimates are identified from changes in a worker’s pay, industry-level employment flows and regulation over time. the main finding is that the regulation of network industries provides workers in this industry with a wage premium and higher employment stability relative to similar workers in other industries. regulatory reform therefore tends to align labour income and employment stability in the reformed industry with those in other industries. workers in the reformed industry lose out compared with others, because they no longer benefit from “excess” pay and employment stability.
473@The distributional impact of structural reforms@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jln041nkpwc-en@in a majority of oecd countries, gdp growth over the past three decades has been associated with growing income disparities. to shed some lights on the potential sources of trade-offs between growth and equity, this paper investigates the long-run impact of structural reforms on household incomes across the distribution, hence on income inequality. the paper builds on a macro-micro approach by combining recent macro-level estimates of the impact of structural reforms on macroeconomic growth with micro-level estimates of the impact of structural reforms on household incomes across the income distribution. it considers the sources of macroeconomic growth, by decomposing growth in gdp per capita into growth in labour utilisation and labour productivity. this allows for shedding light on the mechanisms through which growth and its drivers, including policy drivers, benefit household incomes at different points of the income distribution. most structural reforms are found to have little impact on income inequality when the latter is assessed through measures that emphasise the middle class. by contrast, a higher number of structural reforms, in particular social protection reforms, are found to have an impact on income inequality and thus may raise tradeoffs and synergies between growth equity objectives when inequality is assessed through measures that emphasise relatively more incomes among the poor. this corresponds to higher degrees of inequality aversion.
474@The distribution of the growth dividends@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/7c8c6cc1-en@widespread increases in inequality over the past three decades have raised the question of the distribution of the growth dividends. this paper finds that there is no single answer to this question. the mechanisms that link growth and income inequality are found to differ depending on the sources of growth and on whether one considers income inequality before or after government redistribution, that is, inequality in market incomes, i.e. income derived before taxes and transfers, or inequality in disposable incomes, that is, income after taxes and transfers. labour productivity growth is found to have contributed to rising market income inequality, while this was partly mitigated through government redistribution, on average across oecd countries over the last decades. by contrast, employment growth is found to have had an equalising impact, benefiting mostly the households in the lower part of the income distribution. these two forces tended to offset each other and resulted in a broadly distribution-neutral impact of gdp per capita growth, on average across oecd countries over the last three decades. while inequality has risen in many countries, this would tend to suggest that factors other than gdp growth itself have been driving widening income gaps between rich and poor households.

An empirical assessment@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jln0421ld25-en@certain growth-promoting policies can have negative side-effects by increasing the vulnerability of economies to financial crises. typical examples are greater openness to financial flows or more liberalised financial markets. this paper investigates whether the growth benefits of policy reforms in these growth-enhancing areas, and others such as trade openness, exceed the possible costs of occasional, albeit potentially severe, crises for a sample of 100 developed and emerging economies from 1970 to 2010. the results suggest that the pro-growth effects of greater capital account openness outweigh the negative effects of a higher propensity to twin crises. greater domestic financial liberalisation is associated with faster growth, but also with a higher propensity to systemic banking and twin crises. a free floating exchange rate and greater openness to trade, by reducing the likelihood of currency crises, are associated with higher growth. while pro-competitive product market regulations and lower corporate taxes are associated with higher growth, they do not seem to influence financial fragility via higher probability of crises.
476@How do policies influence GDP tail risks?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jln0428l1wl-en@this paper explores the relationship between policy settings and extreme positive and negative growth events, what we call gdp tail risks, using quantile regression methods. conditioning on several country characteristics such as the size, stage of development and openness to trade as well as macroeconomic policies, the following findings for a panel of mostly oecd countries emerge: first, countries with stronger banking supervision and capital market development, better quality of governance, higher foreign reserves and several labour market characteristics such as higher unemployment benefits and greater spending in active labour market policies tend to experience less severe negative growth shocks (negative tail risk). second, greater use of macro-prudential tools is generally associated with less extreme positive growth shocks (positive tail risk) and lower average growth. third, larger automatic stabilisers are associated with both less severe negative and positive growth shocks but also lower average growth.
477@Malaysia: Boosting productivity key to fostering inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/malaysia-boosting-productivity-key-to-fostering-inclusive-growth.htm@11/11/2016 - malaysia’s economy has proven resilient to global headwinds, but more can be done to boost innovation, raise productivity and shift to a more sustainable growth path that will boost living standards for all, according to two new reports from the oecd. the first-ever oecd economic assessment of malaysia recognises that growth is moderating, but it remains cushioned by domestic demand and should be above 4% in both 2016 and 2017. the assessment underlines the need to continue fiscal consolidation, to provide a buffer should conditions deteriorate, and lays out a series of reform recommendations for maintaining economic resilience, raising productivity and fostering inclusiveness.a new review of innovation policy of malaysia shows that malaysia has expanded its science, technology and innovation ambitions, raising r&d spending to nearly 1.3% of gdp in 2014, from 0.2% in 1996, and investing strongly in education and skills. to progress further, and raise the chances of innovation-led productivity gains, malaysia should modernise its public research institutes, enhance their links with universities and provide more public support to firms to boost the private sector’s potential to innovate. better coordination between and streamlining of the myriad of public bodies involved in science, technology and innovation policy making would also be helpful.the two reports were presented in putrajaya by oecd deputy secretary-general rintaro tamaki and tan sri dr ali hamsa, chief secretary to the government of malaysia.“malaysia's economic performance stands out, both for its profound transformation into a diversified economy as well as for the striking reduction in poverty levels,” mr tamaki said. “malaysia is on the path to becoming a high-income country around 2020, but achieving this goal will be challenging. while the economy remains resilient, productivity growth has slowed in recent years and malaysian firms are facing new competition from their east asian peers. the two reports launched today identify policy responses to these challenges.”the economic assessment highlights the importance of promoting innovation, as recommended by the review of innovation policy of malaysia report; enhancing the quality of education and training; of increasing the availability of a high-skilled workforce and of improving malaysia’s attractiveness for investment in high value-added activities. other key measures to lift productivity include an independent review of public sector productivity; enhancing the independence, staffing and resources of the competition regulator; expanding merger control powers; amending insolvency laws and introducing out-of-court insolvency procedures; and further liberalisation of the services sector.to foster more inclusive growth, malaysia should develop a more comprehensive social protection system, including implementation of an employment insurance scheme; promote flexible work arrangements and invest more in early childhood care, lifelong learning and re-skilling; increase pension access ages, in line with improvements in life expectancy, while reducing exemptions for early withdrawal; enrol future public employees in the defined contribution pension scheme covering private sector employees; and improve social services, transport and broadband connectivity in remote rural areas.an overview of the economic assessment, with the main conclusions, will be freely accessible at: www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-malaysia.htm.the executive summary of the review of innovation policy will be freely accessible at: www.oecd.org/countries/malaysia/oecd-reviews-of-innovation-policy-malaysia-9789264255340-en.htm. you are invited to include links to the reports in media coverage.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
478@Balancing inclusiveness, work incentives and sustainability in Denmark@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jln042kcjjg-en@the generous danish welfare state relies on a high degree of labour force participation both for financing and in order to ensure social cohesion. this underlines the need for getting work incentives right and improve the employability of vulnerable groups of workers, in particular migrants. many benefit recipients also face high marginal tax rates for returning to work, creating a barrier for inclusion. likewise, as the population ages, the need for longer working lives becomes a central aim. in denmark, much has been done to keep older workers in the labour market, but there is further scope for reducing barriers to work for this group, including through the design of the pension system. cost pressures at social institutions could be addressed by better reaping the effects on municipal reform, more coordination between different service providers, and open the market for social services, for instance old age care, for private suppliers under a strict quality monitoring framework.
479@The use of models in producing OECD macroeconomic forecasts@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-use-of-models-in-producing-oecd-macroeconomic-forecasts_5jlnb59tmdls-en@this paper firstly describes the role of models in producing oecd global macroeconomic forecasts; secondly, reviews the oecd's forecasting track record; and finally, considers the relationship between forecast performance and models. oecd forecasts are not directly generated from a single global model, but instead rely heavily on expert judgment which is informed by inputs from a range of different models, with forecasts subjected to repeated peer review. for the major oecd economies, current year gdp growth forecasts exhibit a number of desirable properties including that they are unbiased, outperform naïve forecasts and mostly identify turning points. moreover, there is a trend improvement in current-year forecasting performance which is partly attributed to the increasing use of high frequency ‘now-casting’ indicator models to forecast the current and next quarter’s gdp. conversely, the track record of one-year-ahead forecasts is much less impressive; such forecasts are biased, often little better than naïve forecasts and are poor at anticipating downturns. forecasts tend to cluster around those from other international organisations and consensus forecasts; it is particularly striking that differences in one-year-ahead forecasts between forecasters are relatively minor in comparison with the size of average errors made by all of them. this may reflect herding behaviour by forecasters as well as the mean reversion properties of models. these weaknesses in forecasting performance beyond the current year underline the importance of increased efforts to use models to characterise the risk distribution around the baseline forecast, including through the increased use of model-based scenario analysis.

481@Tax reforms, more efficient public spending and better public governance, keys to consolidating Indonesia’s strong economic progress@http://www.oecd.org/economy/tax-reforms-more-efficient-public-spending-and-better-public-governance-keys-to-consolidating-indonesia-s-strong-economic-progress.htm@"24/10/2016 - indonesia has undergone an extraordinary transformation over the past two decades, benefiting from strong growth that has lifted millions out of poverty and allowed important progress in areas such as health and education. but low levels of public spending and tax revenue are undermining the quality of social services and exacerbating infrastructure gaps, according to the oecd.in its 2016 economic survey of indonesia, the oecd finds that indonesia’s tax base is narrow and that compliance is weak. of indonesia’s 260 million citizens, only 27 million were registered taxpayers in 2014, and only 900,000 paid what they owed. increasing revenues is critical to financing investment and social programmes. the number of taxpayers should also be increased through improved compliance and more efficient tax collection. public spending efficiency also needs to be improved. the oecd concludes that while the removal of some fuel subsidies has supported increased spending in priority areas such as health, education and infrastructure, further action is needed. expenditure on inefficient energy subsidies remains very high ─ accounting for around 7% of public spending ─ and encourages pollution-intensive activities. these subsidies should be phased out, complemented by investments in renewable and geothermal energy to meet rising energy needs.the oecd notes that the quality of public governance in indonesia ranks poorly when compared with other major emerging economies. the government’s policy of targeting 20% of government spending on education and 5% on health must be accompanied by improved controls and performance-based budgeting to improve efficiency.corruption remains the main impediment to doing business in indonesia. the oecd recommends providing the corruption eradication commission (kpk) with more resources and authority, and supporting the expansion of its training activities into indonesia’s regions to help sub‑national governments better identify and address corruption.decentralisation has progressed rapidly in indonesia and sub-national governments now account for around half of all public spending. nevertheless, significant inequalities between regions persist. the oecd suggests improving the technical capacity of sub-national governments to improve spending and budget administration and increase revenue raising sources. in the short-term, the oecd recommends that grants should be directed to national priority areas.continued reliance on coal, untaxed fossil fuel consumption, and poor enforcement of indonesia’s laws against deforestation by burning threatens indonesia’s unique ecosystems, exacerbates air pollution and contributes to rising greenhouse gas emissions, the oecd adds.the survey is accompanied by the oecd’s 2016 open government review of indonesia, which outlines the policies needed to foster a culture of integrity in the public sector, encourage innovation, and promote greater citizen participation.among the review’s recommendations is the need to improve the quality and quantity of data and information accessible to the public throughout the budget cycle. it also suggests that indonesia develop a coherent approach on the use of digital technologies across levels of government. participatory platforms should be expanded to achieve a critical mass of users, and other potentially high-impact initiatives should be enhanced and streamlined. the review also recommends that the government continues to strengthen the link between its open government agenda and its efforts to implement the sustainable development goals (sdgs).launching the two reports in jakarta alongside the oecd-indonesia programme of work for 2017‑18, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “more and more indonesians are enjoying higher standards of living thanks to indonesia’s remarkable economic and social progress. many challenges remain, but the government is moving in the right direction by reducing obstacles to doing business, improving the investment environment, and cutting subsidies.”“the oecd’s relationship with indonesia continues to deepen, and we stand ready to support indonesia’s strategic priorities and reforms in key areas,” he said.the new programme of work will focus on the business climate; social policies; governance; and the environment to promote dynamic, inclusive and green growth. the oecd will also contribute to indonesia’s efforts to implement the sdgs.for further information about the 2016 economic survey of indonesia, the 2016 open government review of indonesia or the oecd-indonesia programme of work for 2017-18, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (news.contact@oecd.org;

482@OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría presents new OECD studies with economic and social recommendations to Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-secretary-general-angel-gurria-presents-new-oecd-studies-with-economic-and-social-recommendations-to-peruvian-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski.htm@14/10/2016 - economic and social reforms undertaken over the past two decades have driven peruvian efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth and important reductions in poverty. against a context of weak global growth, peru will need to diversify its economy, boost skills, reinforce productivity across the labour force and unleash the potential of all regions in order to spur more inclusive national growth, according to new analysis presented today by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd).oecd secretary-general angel gurría and peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski discussed the implementation of the oecd country programme with peru, in support of the country’s ongoing economic, governance and social reform. the president and mr. gurría opened the foro perú ocde 2016, where experts will reflect on peru’s reform agenda on the basis of the studies and policy recommendations included in the oecd reviews.“the oecd and peru engaged in a fruitful dialogue on the direction and design of public policies, and we are extremely encouraged by the results to date,” mr. gurría said. “our objectives in the peru country programme are in line with those of president kuczynski and his government, and have the main goal of improving public policies for more inclusive growth. we are pleased to report today on new areas of policy analysis, including economic diversification, territorial development, public governance and skills and vocational training. we are encouraged by the commitment of the peruvian government to collaborate with the oecd, and expect this fruitful relationship to continue and expand in the coming years.”the oecd country programme with peru was launched in december 2014. it includes 19 projects in a broad range of policy areas, with several policy reviews analysing challenges met in various areas such as the effectiveness and integrity of the public sector, vocational training, skills, youth employment, health, statistics and environmental policy.through the country programme, peru adheres to selected oecd legal instruments and initiatives, such as the declaration on propriety, integrity and transparency (pit) or the anti-bribery convention. peru has been a member of the oecd development centre since 2009 and it participates actively in several oecd committees and working groups, for example the policy dialogue on global value chains for production transformation and development and the policy dialogue on natural resource-based development.four reviews included in the oecd-peru country programme were presented today by the secretary-general to president kuczynski:volume 2 of the multidimensional country review on peru notes that economic diversification towards promising new sectors including agro-industry, manufacturing and tourism is necessary, and will require new and increasing efforts to boost productivity. it also points out the importance of improving the transport sector, where costs far above those seen in oecd countries are holding back trade and regional development. and it highlights the need to continue reform efforts to reduce the scope of the informal sector, which today still covers 70% of all workers. the review provides key recommendations in each of these three domains, highlighting that better management of commodity-based resources is necessary to increase economic diversification.; effective investment in research and development at the regional level and strategic planning is critical to boost productivity and innovation; the implementation of a national transport agenda supporting multimodality and better use of existing logistics can help reduce transport costs; and a comprehensive agenda including better labour market regulation, effective skills and lower formalisation costs is instrumental to promote and boost formal jobs.the public governance review of peru identifies where the government performs well alongside those areas where it could improve to ensure the design and delivery of strategic policy and public services that sustain better outcomes for people and businesses. the review examines co-ordination from the centre of government, evidence-based strategic planning and the decentralisation process to improve co-ordination across levels of government. it assesses the management of the civil service, legal and regulatory frameworks to implement digital government, and open-government and transparency policies. and it provides recommendations to assist the government bolster its agility in setting, steering and implementing a national medium-term strategy for achieving inclusive growth and prosperity for all. the territorial review of peru suggests that solutions for peru’s productivity and diversification challenges will be enhanced through a more comprehensive approach to managing the development of the country’s diverse regions, cities and rural areas, most of which are not very well-connected and have widely-differing sources and potential for growth. realising this regional growth potential will require integrated policies that are tailored to the specific circumstances of these places and can simultaneously improve skills, innovation, infrastructure and the business environment. according to this report, better prioritisation of public investment and the integration of these priorities within fiscal frameworks in partnership with sub-national governments should be a key priority, in addition to improving sub-national finance and improving the system of territorial statistics. skills beyond school – vocational education and training review recognises that vocational education and training (vet) is crucial to developing a highly-skilled labour force. peru is shown to have an extensive array of vet programmes, with over 2000 mostly private vet providers, and steadily increasing enrolments. while peruvians have demonstrated a keen interest in developing their skills, and some vet programmes provide very high-quality vocational education and training, the new review offers ample evidence that existing programmes and institutions are falling short of meeting the country’s needs. a combination of well-crafted public policies and strategic investments can help better steer vet institutions toward high-quality offerings, facilitate student transitions along education and career pathways, empower students, and broaden access to groups that are currently unable to participate because of financial or other constraints.the oecd secretary-general’s visit to lima included his participation in the annual meeting of apec finance ministers as well as bilateral discussions with president kuczynski and various members of the government.the paris-based oecd is an international organisation that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. it provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to the economic, social, and governance challenges they face.the oecd's 35 members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, latvia, luxembourg, mexico, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, slovak republic, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.three countries – colombia, costa rica and lithuania – have been formally invited to become members of the organisation, and are currently in the process of accession. the oecd established country programmes in 2013 as a new instrument for supporting dynamic, emerging economies in designing their reforms and strengthening public policies. peru is one of three partner economies - along with kazakhstan and morocco - to have been invited in 2014 to undertake a country programme.for further information, contact oecd media officer lawrence speer (+33 1 4524 7970) or the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
483@Advance warning indicators of past severe GDP per capita recessions in Turkey@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlpq7swq4wf-en@the global financial crisis and its high economic and social costs have revived academic and policy interest in “early warning indicators” of crises. this paper aims to investigate the performance of vulnerability indicators as advance warning indicators of past severe gdp per capita recessions in turkey. it draws on the recently established database of vulnerability indicators (röhn et al., 2015) and employs the signalling approach as in hermansen and röhn (2015) complemented by visual inspections to detect vulnerability indicators that performed particularly well in the turkish context. the evidence suggests that an index of the global stock market performs extremely well in the turkish context. this index, which could be interpreted as a proxy for the risk appetite of global investors, exceeded its critical threshold before almost all past severe gdp per capita recessions in turkey while sending only very few false alarms. among domestic indicators, large positive deviations of household credit and the domestic stock market from trend also perform relatively well in signalling subsequent past severe gdp per capita recessions. the evidence is broadly robust to considering a more homogenous set of lower income oecd countries when defining the critical thresholds.
484@Realising and expanding opportunities in the United States@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlpq7t9vzbx-en@measures that enable the acquisition of new skills and reduce mismatches between the demand and supply of existing skills can boost us economic growth and make its benefits more inclusive. although overall schooling performance has generally improved over time, many disadvantaged students still fail to achieve basic numeracy and literacy. many parents are denied the opportunity to make their most productive contribution to the economy due to a lack of paid parental leave provisions, publicly-funded childcare and early-childhood education. discrimination against individuals on the basis of race and gender or those with criminal records can also create barriers to opportunity. some geographic areas of the country are performing very well, while others are being held back by governance structures that are ill-equipped to deal with economic, social, and environmental challenges. getting the right policies and infrastructure in place in a timely manner can expand opportunity in these areas.
485@The skills of Polish emigrants – evidence from PIAAC@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlpq7tg3hxs-en@based on the oecd data from the survey of adult skills (piaac) this paper sheds light on the skills of migrants. in line with earlier research the data show that migrants from poland are more likely to have a tertiary degree than peers at home, but they often work in elementary professions abroad that do not match these high qualifications. this may well be at least partly a language issue, as migrants from poland resemble migrants from other low-income countries in that their numeracy and literacy skills in the language of their host country is markedly lower than the average across all piaac participants, migrants or not. this gap is smaller, though, when looking only at migrants who report having been tested in a language that they use often and master well. the data reveal an interesting difference with migrants from higher-income countries, as their test results do not differ from the average, although they face the same language issues as other migrants. the reason may well be that only migrants from low-income countries can hope to earn higher wages abroad even if they work in low-skill professions, while migrants from higher-income countries need to master the language of their host country to do well. in fact, polish migrants earn higher wages than their peers who stayed at home, even though they are particularly often overqualified.
486@Fiscal decentralisation and income inequality: empirical evidence from OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlpq7tm05r6-en@this paper investigates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and economy-wide disposable income inequality. drawing on a dataset of up to 20 oecd countries over a period from 1996 to 2011, a regression analysis is performed, relating several indicators of national income inequality and a wide array of fiscal decentralisation indicators. the results indicate a weak, inequality-reducing relationship between decentralisation and income inequality, as measured by the gini coefficient, but the effect is rather small and unstable across specifications. fine-graining the analysis by using income percentile ratios, in turn, produces more significant and stable results. it shows that the effects of fiscal decentralisation are not the same along the income distribution. while decentralisation tends to be associated with a reduction in income inequality between high incomes and the median, it is linked to a divergence of low income groups from the median, notably via sub-central tax autonomy. transfers between levels of government also tend to increase the gap between lower and middle incomes. interpreting these effects jointly, it seems that mainly middle income earners benefit from fiscal decentralisation. finally, some insights on decentralisation and regional income inequality are presented. at first sight, fiscal decentralisation does not seem to be associated with income sorting in large jurisdictions, but a more fine-grained analysis is required to answer this question.
487@Fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlpq7v3j237-en@fiscal decentralisation can lead to a more efficient provision of local public goods and services and promote a better match between policies and citizens’ preferences. at the same time, however, there are concerns about whether all regions will gain from more autonomy. decentralisation may not lift all boats, with “poor” regions losing competitiveness with respect to better endowed ones, thus increasing regional disparities. the present work investigates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional inequality within countries. particular attention is paid to the different channels through which decentralisation can affect disparities: taxing powers, spending autonomy and the vertical fiscal imbalance. the empirical analysis, which is conducted on a sample of 30 oecd countries for the period 1995-2011, suggests that a balanced fiscal structure, where local spending is mainly financed by local taxation, reduces regional disparities, by providing an incentive to better use local resources and implement policies that favour economic development.
488@Unleashing private sector productivity in the United States@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlpq7zk4j30-en@productivity growth has been sluggish since the great recession and had been slowing before it. this slowdown has touched nearly every industry. although part the slowdown may be related to weakness of investment related to the slow recovery of aggregate demand, structural issues also appear to be playing a role, including persistent declines in business dynamism (market entry and exit of firms) and signs of diminishing competitive pressures. historically, young productive firms have been an important source of productivity growth, but start-up rates have been slowing for some time and have been especially low in the aftermath of the crisis, and failure rates of new firms have risen. this diminished dynamism appears to be associated with other trends such as population ageing, funding difficulties, reforms in 2005 to the personal bankruptcy code that made debt discharge more difficult, intellectual property rights that favour some established companies, the spread of state-level occupational licensing requirements, as well as zoning and land use restrictions that inhibit resources from flowing to their most productive use. there are also signs that market power is gradually intensifying on balance, restraining competitive forces that would otherwise translate productivity gains into broad-based improvements in household purchasing power.
489@Labour market reforms in Korea to promote inclusive growth@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlr3cvdf35k-en@labour market reforms are essential to promote social cohesion by removing obstacles to employment, particularly for women, youth and older persons. in addition to reducing income inequality and poverty, such reforms would also sustain economic growth as korea’s working-age population begins to decline in 2017. breaking down labour market duality is crucial to reduce the wide wage disparity. better conditions for non-regular workers would in turn promote greater labour participation. increasing the take-up of maternity and parental leave, expanding the availability of high-quality childcare, reducing working time, narrowing the large gender wage gap and eliminating discrimination would also increase opportunities for women. boosting youth employment from its current low level requires addressing labour market mismatch by better aligning the skills learned in school with those demanded by employers. reducing the emphasis on seniority in setting wages by moving to more flexible systems and expanding training to improve the skills of older persons would allow them to extend their careers, thereby reducing old-age poverty.
490@Raising Korea’s productivity through innovation and structural reform@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlr3tl19gkd-en@raising productivity requires addressing a wide range of policies that affect resource allocation, the creation and diffusion of technology, human capital and the creation and financing of start-ups. the greatest gains can be achieved in the service sector and in smes, where productivity has fallen to less than a third of large firms. regulatory reform, increased international openness and labour flexibility would support such reallocation and technology diffusion. korea’s large investment in r&d and education should be leveraged to raise productivity by enhancing university and public research and strengthening its links with the business sector and global innovation networks. to take advantage of innovation, the relatively low skill levels of workers above age 35 calls for increased lifelong learning. perhaps most important, it is essential to shift sme policies away from promoting the survival of firms and towards productivity gains. given market failures in indirect financing, developing capital markets, including venture capital investment, is a priority to boost firm creation. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of korea (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-korea.htm)

created prosperity for all. indeed, inequality and poor job prospects in disadvantaged areas remain major sources of social distress,” mr gurría said. “only with a concerted effort on reforms to create more open and inclusive economies and improve governance will we achieve stability, prosperity and opportunities for all, especially the young.” (read the full speech in french)the oecd’s new report, “better policies for inclusive growth and economic integration in the mena region”, provides a roadmap for the mena-oecd initiative, identifying the priority structural reforms needed to make more inclusive and sustainable growth a reality.economic growth in the mena region was 2.3% in 2015 versus an average of 4.0% for emerging and developing countries. foreign direct investment in the mena region has fallen by 50% since 2008 to an all-time low of 1% of gdp in 2015, with regulatory and administrative obstacles a key deterrent to foreign investors. regional instability and insecurity is also weighing on fdi as well as tourism, which has dropped sharply in tunisia and egypt. intra-regional trading is scarce, with only 10% of the region’s trade taking place between mena countries.to overcome these problems, market access needs to be deepened through trade and investment agreements, a reduction in regulatory and administrative obstacles and improved investor protection. in addition, it is essential to improve the quality of the region’s transport and logistics infrastructure to enhance connectivity. a new four-year eu-oecd programme on promoting investment in the mediterranean, launched at the mena-oecd forum, will work with governments to support investment reforms, modernise investment policies and establish institutions to attract investors.youth unemployment in the mena region rose to 29% in 2015 – the highest of any region in the world. joblessness is most severe in remote rural areas but even graduates struggle to find jobs due to a mismatch between skills demand and supply. the oecd report “youth in the mena region” notes that although students were among the most active drivers of the arab spring uprisings, opportunities for youth associations to influence policy remain limited.also women remain an untapped resource for mena economies, especially in light of important improvements in their educational attainment. only 21% women were employed or looking for paid work in 2014, well below the oecd average of 54%, and well below the rate of participation in the labour force of men in the mena region (74%).more flexible labour regulations are needed, together with programmes to address the specific needs of vulnerable groups. expanding and enhancing the quality of vocational education and training can also help improve employment opportunities and address skills mismatches.private businesses will be essential for economic recovery, yet the private sector accounts for only 40% of gdp in the mena region versus an oecd average of 59%. in libya, the share is just 5%. through specific projects focused on the role of smes in libya’s reconstruction and the promotion of investment in iraq, the oecd is already working with countries affected by conflict to prepare them for the longer-term future of their economies.the oecd is also committed to supporting mena countries in their efforts to:• build resilient institutions, particularly in countries hit by instability or conflict, to foster ambitious structural reforms.• raise standards at public administrations and make them more transparent. introduce mechanisms such as codes of conduct to improve integrity and fight corruption in the public sector, particularly in procurement. improve access to justice for all.• develop policies to support private sector development to boost competitiveness and encourage diversification away from oil. this should include reducing burdensome regulations, improving corporate governance, providing easier access to finance and upgrading infrastructure and services to better connect producers to markets.• enhance tax collection to expand the tax burden from the few individuals and businesses that pay taxes today and thus increase tax revenues. this should include introducing vat and income taxes to countries that lack them and reducing tax exemptions.• raise secondary school attendance and improve teaching standards to tackle the relatively high share of low-performing students. address skills mismatches at adult level and better integrate women and youth into economies.download new oecd reports on the

492@Raising well-being in Germany’s ageing society@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlr3ctrc8bn-en@population ageing is setting in earlier in germany than in most other oecd economies and will be marked. it could lead to a substantial decline in employment, weighing on gdp per capita, and will raise demand for health-related public services. germany has already implemented far-reaching reforms to mitigate the implications of ageing for per capita income, well-being and the sustainability of public finances. nonetheless, continued efforts are needed to help older workers to improve their work-life balance and adjust their working hours to their ability and desire to work. moreover, stressful working conditions and unhealthy lifestyles contribute to poor self-reported health and reduce the ability and willingness to work at higher age. there is scope to promote life-long learning. as the generosity of the public pension system will diminish, the contribution of private pensions to ensure pension adequacy needs to be strengthened.
493@Boosting investment performance in Germany@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlr3cv53241-en@non-residential investment has fallen over the past 20 years as a share of gdp and is now lower than in several other high-income oecd countries. business investment growth has been weak since the outbreak of the global financial and economic crisis. government investment has been low, especially at municipal level. investment in knowledge-based capital (kbc), which is closely related to long-term productivity performance, has been subdued. weak growth prospects in the euro area have weighed on business investment and an increasing share of firms invests in distant, more dynamic markets. policies that strengthen stability and growth prospects in the euro area would raise the attractiveness of germany as a location to invest, notably steps to strengthen the single market and cross-border infrastructure, and complete the banking union. steps to liberalise regulation of services, in particular knowledge-intensive professional services, would raise investment and productivity. policies that encourage the reallocation of resources would also increase investment in kbc. poor municipalities invest relatively little and there is scope to lower the cost of public investment projects. better use of e-governance and more performance-oriented budgeting could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public investment.

495@Green shoots of recovery in entrepreneurship beginning to appear@http://www.oecd.org/economy/green-shoots-of-recovery-in-entrepreneurship-beginning-to-appear.htm@28/09/2016 - the post-crisis recovery in entrepreneurial activity remains mixed across countries, but new data released today by the oecd provides tentative signs of a turning point, with trends in enterprise creation rates pointing upwards in most economies.entrepreneurship at a glance 2016 suggests that a revival in entrepreneurial activity could help improve economic growth and provide an important longer-term boost to productivity, given the positive link between start-up rates and productivity growth. the report shows that post-crisis growth in europe has been more dependent on small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) as drivers of economic growth than in the united states. it also offers new evidence that small firms face greater challenges than large firms in breaking into emerging markets. data in this year’s report from a new, innovative online monthly survey prepared by facebook, the oecd and the world bank also points to a more positive outlook among new entrepreneurs present on facebook.the future of business survey, which covers small businesses with active facebook sites in 22 countries worldwide, provides new insights on the importance of creative destruction and innovation. it shows that the proportion of young firms - those that are less than three years old - that have a more positive outlook and expect to increase employment in the short term is higher than the corresponding proportion of established firms - those that are more than 10 years old - in nearly all countries.the oecd confirms that most countries continue to show gender gaps in factors that are key to entrepreneurship, but new evidence from the future of business survey reveals that, once up and running, women are as confident as men about their business. men are on average more likely to declare that they could access funding to set up a business and that they have the training to do so. these gender gaps likely explain differences in outcomes: 5.1% of men aged 15-24 are self-employed, versus 3.6 percent of women in this age group, while 29.2% of employed men aged 55+ are self-employed, compared with 15.9% for women.“no single indicator can adequately cover a topic as complex as entrepreneurship,” said oecd chief statistician martine durand. “it is by looking at a series of factors – from market conditions to the regulatory framework, enterprise culture and access to finance – that we are able to fully take the pulse on the state of entrepreneurial activity and make policy recommendations that will contribute to enhancing it.”• growth in the number of smes in the euro area has outpaced that in the us but the reverse is true for large enterprises. because smes typically have lower labour productivity, this may point to structural factors underpinning the productivity gap between the euro area and the united states.• small firms typically only export to neighbouring markets. european small/micro-enterprises, for example, account for nearly 20% of trade with nearby destinations, but only for slightly more than 5% of exports to china or the united states. fostering export opportunities to more distant, and particularly new emerging markets, and helping address barriers to sme trade can stimulate growth and entrepreneurialism.• very few smes export in tangible capital-intensive industries. but, disproportionately more do so in activities that are built on knowledge capital, such as marketing or design, or other niches, where intangible capital plays a greater role. policies that nurture smes in knowledge-based sectors and niche activities can be a route to export success.entrepreneurship at a glance presents indicators of entrepreneurship collected by the oecd-eurostat entrepreneurship indicators programme (eip). started in 2006, the programme develops multiple measures of entrepreneurship and its determinants according to a conceptual framework that distinguishes between the manifestation of entrepreneurship, the factors that influence it, and the impacts of entrepreneurship on the economy.note: live interview at 15h15 about the future of business on facebook live, with oecd chief statistician martine durand, world bank lead economist gero carletto, and facebook vice president for europe, middle east & africa nicola mendelsohn.for further information on entrepreneurship at a glance 2016, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).

497@OECD warns weak trade and financial distortions damage global growth prospects@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-warns-weak-trade-and-financial-distortions-damage-global-growth-prospects.htm@"21/9/2016 - weak trade growth and financial distortions are exacerbating slow global economic growth, according to the oecd’s latest interim economic outlook.exceptionally low – and in some cases negative – interest rates are distorting financial markets and raising risks across the financial system. a disconnect between rising bond and equity prices and falling profit and growth expectations, combined with over-heating real estate markets in many countries, increases the vulnerability of investors to a sharp correction in asset prices.“the marked slowdown in world trade underlines concerns about the robustness of the economy and the difficulties in exiting the low-growth trap,” said oecd chief economist catherine l. mann. “while weak demand is surely playing a role in the trade slowdown, a lack of political support for trade policies whose benefits could be widely shared is of deep concern.”monetary policy is becoming over-burdened. countries must implement fiscal and structural policy actions to reduce the over-reliance on central banks and ensure opportunity and prosperity for future generations.”the oecd projects that the global economy will grow by 2.9 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 2017, which is well below long-run averages of around 3¾ percent. the small downgrade in the global outlook since the previous economic outlook in june 2016 reflects downgrades in major advanced economies, notably the united kingdom for 2017, offset by a gradual improvement in major emerging-market commodity producers. growth among the major advanced economies will be subdued. in the united states, where solid consumption and job growth is countered by weak investment, growth is estimated at 1.4 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2017. the euro area is projected to grow at a 1.5 percent rate in 2016 and a 1.4 percent pace in 2017. germany is forecast to grow by 1.8 percent in 2016 and 1.5 percent in 2017, france by 1.3 percent in both 2016 and 2017, while italy will see a 0.8 percent growth rate this year and next.in the united kingdom, growth is slowing following the 23 june referendum to leave the european union. while a strong response from the bank of england has helped stabilise markets, uncertainty remains extremely high and risks are clearly on the downside. in this environment, the uk is projected to grow by 1.8 percent in 2016 and 1 percent in 2017, well below the pace in recent years.growth in japan will remain weak and uneven, at 0.6 percent in 2016 and 0.7 percent in 2017, with the appreciation of the yen and weak asian trade weighing on exports. canadian growth is projected at 1.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2017.china is expected to continue facing challenges as it rebalances its economy from manufacturing-led demand toward consumption and services. chinese growth is forecast at 6.5 percent in 2016 and 6.2 percent in 2017. india will continue to grow robustly, by 7.4 percent in 2016 and 7.5 percent in 2017. despite some improvements, brazil’s economy continues experiencing a deep recession, and is expected to shrink by 3.3 percent this year and a further 0.3 percent in 2017.the interim economic outlook renews calls for a stronger collective response using fiscal, structural and trade policies to boost growth. on the fiscal front, low interest rates offer governments additional fiscal space for investing in human capital and physical infrastructure to promote short-term demand, long-term output and inclusiveness.on the structural side, more ambitious policies are needed, particularly those that boost trade, including commitments to stand still on new protectionist measures, roll back existing ones and urgently tackle other obstacles to trade and investment.the oecd is today releasing an economics policy paper, cardiac arrest or dizzy spell: why is world trade so weak and what can policy do about it? in conjunction with the outlook.media queries should be directed to the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700, news.contact@oecd.org).for more information, visit: www.oecd.org/economy/economic-outlook. handout for the press (pdf).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world."
498@OECD to help put innovation at heart of G20 global growth strategy@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-to-help-put-innovation-at-heart-of-g20-global-growth-strategy.htm@"5/9/2016 - leaders of the g20 countries meeting at their summit in hangzhou, china, have called on the oecd to help develop an agenda to build a stronger, more innovative and inclusive world economy.the leaders endorsed a series of action plans to implement their growth strategies covering a broad swathe of policy areas – from innovation and skills to entrepreneurship and investment finance; from improving productivity and trade to tackling money laundering, combatting tax avoidance and reducing overcapacity in the steel sector. a central focus of china’s g20 presidency has been the need to identify new driving forces for economic growth. the oecd has contributed ideas, analysis and data in support of the presidency's goal to integrate an innovation action plan which aims to support investment in science and technology, improve skills and encourage the exchange of knowledge.in their communique, the leaders welcomed the work by the oecd and other international organisations on the measurement of the digital economy and committed to expand broadband access and investment in the information, communications and technology (ict) sector. they also urged countries to seize the opportunities of the so-called new industrial revolution, particularly those offered by new technology in manufacturing. they agreed to strengthen cooperation and research and to support workers most affected by technological change.oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “china is to be congratulated for placing innovation at the heart of their g20 presidency. it is important to not just repair the problems of the past but to lay the foundations for future growth – growth that will to a large extent be driven by new ideas and technologies.”the urgent need to harness new sources of economic dynamism was underlined to summit leaders by mr gurría. the global economy remains stuck in a low-growth trap, he said. eight years after the start of the crisis unemployment and inequality remain high. growth in wages and productivity is weak while trade and investment is low. despite a 2014 g20 commitment – monitored by the oecd and imf – to raise global gdp by an additional 2% by 2018, measures implemented so far will only add around 1%.“we are only halfway there,” said mr gurría. calling for full implementation of the g20 countries’ growth commitments, he added: “structural reforms to promote product market competition, skills upgrading, labour mobility, and financial market robustness are critical to create an environment conducive to the innovation needed to kick-start productivity and bolster long-term, inclusive growth.”to counter a rising risk of protectionism, the g20 leaders said they would endeavour to build an open world economy by strengthening trade and investment cooperation. oecd’s contributions in this area have included helping to draw up guiding principles for investment policy-making and providing analysis to support government efforts to reduce unnecessary trade costs, open services markets, and prioritise trade facilitation measures. investment is the lagging engine of the world economy, and the g20 underscored its important role for a more dynamic global growth.the secretary-general told g20 leaders that effective implementation of reform was already bearing fruit in the areas of tax transparency and in tackling evasion and avoidance.so far 85 nations and jurisdictions – including many developing countries – have committed to implement and monitor the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project through a new g20/oecd inclusive framework. the beps project closes gaps that allow corporate profits to “disappear” or to be artificially shifted to low or no tax environments.meanwhile, 101 jurisdictions will automatically exchange financial account information by 2018. already countries have identified almost 55 billion euros in additional tax revenues thanks to voluntary disclosure and similar programmes. leaders asked the oecd to prepare a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions by their summit in 2017.on tax reform, as across all the action plans discussed by the leaders, robust implementation and coherence among participating countries will be crucial, as the challenges of an increased integrated global economy require continued cooperation.gabriela ramos, the oecd’s chief of staff and sherpa to the g20, said: “the oecd is proud to have been a strategic partner of the chinese g20 presidency across a range of policy areas. going forward, we will facilitate the new g20 task force on innovative growth, and provide a venue to discuss issues such as steel over-capacity.”she also emphasised oecd contributions on other important areas such as the role of skills and training, on investment in infrastructure, and support to small and medium-sized enterprises.the g20 action plan for sustainable development was given a boost on the eve of the summit when the us and china, the world’s two largest economies, announced they would formally ratify the paris climate change agreement. the two countries also released peer reviews of their fossil fuel subsidies – a move welcomed by the oecd, which had chaired the peer review process. the oecd also contributed analysis on green finance, including green bonds, institutional investors and investment governance.further

499@Strengthening competition in network sectors and the internal market in Canada@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlswbxnfdxs-en@canada’s productivity performance has lagged that of many other oecd countries, despite some improvement in recent years. one measure to enhance overall efficiency would be to strengthen competition on the domestic market to drive future multi-factor productivity improvements. the potential gains are large: about a half a percent per year over a fairly long horizon. this paper focuses on increasing competition in network sectors, including energy, telecommunication services and broadcasting, and transportation, which are key inputs to production in the broader economy. improving regulatory conditions, efficiency and/or cost competitiveness could yield more productive outcomes in these sectors, as well as in downstream industries. competition could also be increased by lowering barriers to interprovincial trade and the movement of labour, which act to fragment canada’s already small domestic market. to this end, reforms of the agreement on internal trade and measures to reduce sectoral barriers to trade are also discussed. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-canada.htm)

503@Costa Rica: boosting productivity to sustain income convergence@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv23bhvnq7-en@in the latest 30 years, costa rica's real gdp per capita has more than doubled, driven by increasing labour utilisation. labour productivity has instead stagnated at around 30% of the more advanced oecd countries. productivity growth has been lacklustre despite the opening up of markets to international competition and large fdi inflows. several obstacles continue to hamper the development of domestic firms and markets. they have fostered a dual speed economy characterised, on the one hand, by an innovative, productive and export oriented fdi sector – increasingly focussing on high value added sectors – and, on the other hand, a domestic sector – dominated by small firms and focused on traditional industries – that is neither innovative nor very productive. boosting national productivity to sustain the convergence process towards oecd countries living standards will hinge on creating the right conditions for domestic firms to thrive and become more innovative and productive, while maintaining the long-standing commitment to open international markets and investment. to make this happens the government should: 1) encourage innovation and improving links between domestic and foreign firms by better enforcing and implementing intellectual property rights, shifting public r&d spending towards tertiary education institutions, and improving the coordination of public programmes promoting innovation of local firms and linkages with foreign affiliates; 2) strengthen competition in product markets and ease access to finance for smes by eliminating anti-trust exemptions, empowering the competition commission and giving it more independence, reducing barriers to entrepreneurship, ameliorating the corporate governance of state-owned enterprises and creating a level-playing fields between state-owned and private banks; 3) enhance the institutional and legal framework of the transport and other infrastructure sectors by reducing the number of agencies involved in policy development and project executions, and establishing an institutional framework to reduce policy uncertainty and attract more private investment. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic assessment of costa rica (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-costa-rica.htm).
504@Making public finances more growth and equity-friendly in the euro area@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv2jgl4kbr-en@across the euro area, the ability of public finances to support equitable growth has tended to deteriorate. concerns about high and rising public debt, together with market pressure in some cases, led to sharp fiscal consolidation in 2011-13, against the backdrop of a weak economic situation at the time, which is considered to have made the recession deeper and longer. consolidation has slowed down afterwards, but countries with fiscal space have made limited use of the leeway allowed under eu fiscal rules to support euro area aggregate demand. the expenditure composition has generally become less growth-friendly, with large cuts in public investment. on the revenue side, already high taxes on labour have tended to increase further. structural reforms with direct positive implications for the composition or efficiency of public finances have stalled. while most policy levers to improve public finances remain at the country level, european and national policies can be mutually reinforcing in fiscal governance and public investment. to achieve a euro area fiscal stance that fosters the recovery, countries with fiscal space under the stability and growth pact rules should use budgetary support to raise growth, and existing incentives and flexibility should be taken advantage of to pursue reforms of tax and spending policies. at the national level, it is essential to further upgrade budgetary frameworks, including through the adoption of expenditure rules and regular performance of spending reviews. to promote capital formation and make it more effective, eu budget resources for investment should be deployed in a way to crowd in national public funds and private financing, and foster greater investment productivity. at the national level, better coordination of investment across levels of government and upgraded administrative capacity would increase investment efficiency. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of the euro area (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)
505@Priorities for completing the European Union's Single Market@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv2jhfnt48-en@the eu single market remains far from completed: progress in goods and services market integration has stalled, financial markets are still fragmented along national lines and the barriers to labour mobility remain high. restrictive regulation within countries and regulatory heterogeneity across them hamper the internal market, reducing trade and investment flows. network sectors, such as energy and transportation, are insufficiently interconnected and open to competition, and inefficient as a result. reinvigorating the single market is one of the key tools to strengthen the recovery of the european union and restore faster growth of income per capita. to support the recovery, structural reforms that yield short-run as well as long-run gains should be prioritised. policies enhancing labour and capital mobility are especially relevant, as they provide channels of adjustment to country-specific shocks and reinforce the effectiveness of stabilisation policies. policies enhancing capital mobility include improved securitisation, better collection and sharing of credit information regarding smaller firms and the convergence of insolvency regimes. labour mobility within the european union would profit from reduced administrative and regulatory burden, such as faster recognition of professional qualifications and better portability of social and pension rights. product markets reforms also have the potential to deliver benefits swiftly, not least by unlocking investment. regulatory burdens could be alleviated by better impact assessment for legislative proposals and ex post evaluation of policies. product market reforms in network sectors should include harmonisation of regulations and technical specifications, with the target of establishing single eu regulators. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of the european union (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)
506@Boosting productivity through greater small business dynamism in Canada@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv23k891r8-en@small business dynamism is a feature of an sme sector that contributes to overall productivity growth, not an end in itself. such dynamism increases productivity growth by reallocating resources towards more productive firms and strengthening the diffusion of new technologies. small business dynamism in canada has declined in recent decades, as in other oecd countries, but overall it remains in the middle of the range, with some indicators above average and others below. framework economic policies are generally supportive of small business dynamism, especially labour regulation, but there is scope to reduce regulatory barriers to product market competition. canada has many programmes to support small businesses. some of the largest programmes are not well focused on reducing market failures. focusing support more on reducing clear market failures would increase the contribution of these programmes to productivity growth and living standards. this would likely entail redirecting support from small businesses in general to start-ups and young firms with innovative projects, which would boost small business dynamism. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-canada.htm)
507@Estimating the distributional impact of the Greek crisis (2009-2014)@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv2jl6c9f3-en@estimating the impact of the crisis on income distribution requires up-to-date information. due to the complexity of income surveys such as eu-silc, income data usually become available with considerable delay. in this context, micro-simulation models are an appropriate and widely used alternative to bridge the gap in official data, allowing for an early evaluation of the distributional impact of changes in tax-benefit policies and in the wider economy. this paper analyses the effects of the greek crisis on inequality and poverty in 2009-2014 using the micro-simulation model euromod. specifically, the paper updates earlier oecd estimates of distributional effects of the crisis in 2009-2012, and provides new estimates for 2013-2014, a period for which survey data are not yet publicly available. the results indicate that inequality, as measured by most indicators, rose in 2010-2013 as the recession deepened and unemployment rose, and fell back in 2014 as the economy stabilised. relative poverty seems to have increased in 2012, after remaining broadly unchanged in the previous two years; in 2013 it appears to have stabilised, while in 2014 it fell back to only slightly above its level in 2010 (13.8% vs.13.2% respectively). this pattern is more pronounced when poverty is measured against an “anchored” benchmark: the proportion of population whose income fell below a poverty line anchored in pre-crisis terms increased steadily and steeply, until 2014 when it finally stabilised at 27.4% (from 13.2% in 2010). not all population groups were affected evenly by recent developments: the rise of poverty in 2010-2013 especially affected the unemployed, the self-employed, the young, the middle-aged, families living in athens, families paying rent or mortgage rather than outright owning their dwelling; on the contrary, relative poverty actually fell among groups traditionally seen as ‘poor’, such as farmers and the elderly – although in the latter case the relative improvement in terms of income may have been offset by difficulties in access to health care. the paper also assesses first-round effects of austerity policies on the income distribution given changes in the wider economy, i.e. abstracting from second-round effects associated with the deflationary impact of austerity on output. in this sense, early austerity policies per se appear to have had a small positive distributional impact, partly offsetting the increases in inequality and poverty due to the recession. as fiscal consolidation intensified in 2012, tax and benefit policies appear to have exacerbated the adverse distributional effects of the recession, causing poverty and inequality to rise further. from 2013, austerity policies seem to have had a more equalizing effect, especially at the bottom of the distribution and in terms of its distance from the top. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of greece (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-greece.htm).
508@The short-term impact of product market reforms: a cross-country firm-level analysis@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv2jm07djl-en@this paper analyses the effects of product market reforms in the short and medium term across 10 regulated industries and 18 advanced economies for the period 1998-2013 using internationally comparable firm-level data based on orbis. it provides four key insights. first, product market reforms have positive effects on capital, output and employment and their effects increase over time. after two years, they raise capital by 4%, output by 3% and employment by 1.5%. second, differences in production technology and the nature of product market regulations across sectors generate important differences in the mechanisms through which reforms operate. in network industries, reforms tend to benefit small firms, while the opposite is observed in retail trade. product market reforms also promote firm entry, particularly those that reduce entry barriers. third, credit constraints can play an important role in weakening the positive impact of product market reform on investment. fourth, product market reforms also tend to have positive effects on firms in downstream sectors—both at home and abroad—that make intensive use of intermediate inputs from deregulated sectors.
509@The effects of reform scenarios for unemployment benefits and social assistance on financial incentives to work and poverty in Lithuania@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv2jmtmsmr-en@the effects of reform scenarios for unemployment benefits and social assistance on financial incentives to work and poverty in lithuaniain 2015 the lithuanian government launched an ambitious social model reform agenda aimed at balancing flexibility of the labour market and security provided through the system of social protection. we simulate alternative scenarios for reforming the unemployment benefit and cash social assistance systems in lithuania. we first analyse a reform of the social insurance unemployment benefit along the lines currently proposed by the lithuanian authorities within the new “social model”. the social assistance reforms were left outside of the social model. however, social assistance, as currently designed, has strong negative effects on the work incentives of the recipients. we construct and consider several reform scenarios: extending the current system of in-work payments; establishing earnings disregards; and modifying the equivalence scale for family. we look at the effects of reforms on financial incentives to search and accept a vacancy as measured by the share of additional income that is taxed away through direct taxes, social insurance contributions or through benefit withdrawal when increasing labour supply (effective marginal tax rate). we also investigate the impact of reforms on poverty, income distribution as well as their first-order financial costs. we use microsimulation techniques applied to a representative sample of lithuanian households. our simulations are carried out using euromod –a static tax-benefit microsimulation model developed for the european union. the model uses micro-data from the 2012 lithuanian component of the european union-survey of income and living conditions (silc). this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of lithuania (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-lithuania.htm).j6: labor and demographic economics / mobility, unemployment, vacancies, and immigrant workers; d3: microeconomics / distribution; i3: health, education, and welfare / welfare, well-being, and poverty; j2: labor and demographic economics / demand and supply of labor; d04: microeconomics / general / microeconomic policy: formulation, implementation, and evaluation
510@Insolvency regimes and productivity growth: a framework for analysis@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv2jqhxgq6-en@this paper develops an analytical framework to identify the policies relevant for firm exit and the channels through which they shape aggregate productivity growth. a range of potentially relevant policies are identified, spanning insolvency regimes, regulations affecting product, labour and financial markets, macroeconomic policies, subsidies, taxation and environment regulations. these policies can directly shape aggregate productivity along the exit margin through a variety of channels, including the strength of market selection and the scope and speed at which scarce resources consumed by failing firms can be reallocated to more productive uses. however, since market imperfections often generate obstacles to the orderly exit of failing firms, the efficiency of insolvency regimes emerges as particularly crucial. thus, the paper analyses corporate and personal insolvency regimes in terms of their goals, optimal design (including trade-offs) and key features relevant for explaining cross-country differences in productivity. finally, the paper proposes a strategy to obtain policy indicators that better capture cross-country differences in the key design features of corporate and personal insolvency regimes, with a view to facilitate further research on exit policies and productivity growth.

516@Enhancing private investment in the Netherlands@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlwjg6sq2g6-en@investment has rebounded during the recent economic revival, but from a low level. the investment slump during the crisis was mostly caused by a fall in residential investment. however, business investment has been trending downwards since 1990, holding back capital stock accumulation and productivity. raising residential investment is necessary to meet the growing demand, and in particular more private rental housing is needed as the current small stock, which reflects rental regulation and other housing policies, hampers the functioning of the housing market. financing of owner-occupied housing can be made more resilient by stepping up measures taken after the crisis. regarding business investment, further reinforcing the already good framework conditions would help to turn its cyclical upswing into a durably higher level. meeting targets on r&d expenditure and renewable energy requires lifting investments in the related areas. financing conditions, which are widely perceived as an important bottleneck, could be improved by stimulating competition in the banking sector and the development of alternative financing sources.
517@US economy growing steadily but key reforms needed@http://www.oecd.org/economy/us-economy-growing-steadily-but-key-reforms-needed.htm@16/6/2016 - the us economy is making one of the strongest comebacks in the oecd, but there are risks on the horizon, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of the united states.seven years after the financial crisis, the us economy has rebounded through robust monetary policy support and the well-timed expansion of fiscal policy. output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak by 10%, robust private-sector employment gains have sharply reduced unemployment, and fiscal sustainability has been largely restored. but key reforms are necessary to sustain the recovery.“it’s a recovery, but it’s a stubborn recovery,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said during the survey launch in washington, d.c. with jason furman, chairman of the council of economic advisors. “in so many ways, the us economy is a role model for other oecd countries, but by america’s own high standards the recovery has been mild and risks losing momentum. there is a clear need to rebalance the policy mix and implement mutually reinforcing policies that boost productivity, reduce inequality, and promote sustainable growth.” (read the full speech)the slow speed of the recovery reflects the severity and depth of the financial crisis, fiscal consolidation, the exit of baby boomers from the labour market, weaknesses in key oecd economies, and world trade stagnation induced by the slowdown of china. a broader concern is weakening business sector dynamism. new firms aren’t being created as frequently as in the past and larger firms are increasingly dominating markets. the survey recommends adapting antitrust policy to keep pace with digitalisation, financial innovation, and globalisation to address these issues. shortfalls in public infrastructure must also be remedied.economic activity is, on average, well above pre-crisis peaks, but the revival does not prevail everywhere and is not as widely shared as it could be. the survey notes that income inequalities can be addressed by ensuring that people acquire the skills they need and do not face discrimination or other obstacles in the labour market. it also encourages policies to improve opportunities for women, ethnic and racial minorities, disabled persons, and people with criminal records.according to the survey, private sector job creation has been one of the most welcome aspects of the recovery. the housing market is also improving, with residential house prices in some parts of the country above pre-crisis levels.looking ahead, the survey identifies environmental sustainability as an overarching challenge. the us performs relatively poorly compared to the rest of the oecd on co2 emissions reductions despite the strengthening of fuel economy standards and significant use of policies and incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency at the state level. the survey notes that further measures to abate climate change should include putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions.further information on the economic survey of the united states: www.oecd.org/unitedstates/economic-survey-united-states.htm.journalists are invited to contact the oecd media division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

524@Global economy stuck in low-growth trap: Policymakers need to act to keep promises, OECD says in latest Economic Outlook@http://www.oecd.org/economy/global-economy-stuck-in-low-growth-trap-policymakers-need-to-act-to-keep-promises.htm@1/06/2016 - the global economy is stuck in a low-growth trap that will require more coordinated and comprehensive use of fiscal, monetary and structural policies to move to a higher growth path and ensure that promises are kept to both young and old, according to the oecd’s latest global economic outlook. “growth is flat in the advanced economies and has slowed in many of the emerging economies that have been the global locomotive since the crisis,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said while launching the outlook during the organisation’s annual ministerial council meeting and forum in paris. “slower productivity growth and rising inequality pose further challenges. comprehensive policy action is urgently needed to ensure that we get off this disappointing growth path and propel our economies to levels that will safeguard living standards for all,” mr gurría said. (read the full remarks)weak trade growth, sluggish investment, subdued wages and slower activity in key emerging markets will all contribute to modest global gdp growth of 3% in 2016, essentially the same level as in 2015, according to the outlook. global recovery is expected to improve only to 3.3% in 2017. among the major advanced economies, the moderate recovery will continue in the united states, which is projected to grow by 1.8% in 2016 and 2.2% in 2017. the euro area will improve slowly, with growth of 1.6% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. in japan, growth is projected at 0.7% in 2016 and 0.4% in 2017. the 34-country oecd area is projected to grow by 1.8% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017, according to the outlook. with rebalancing continuing in china, growth is expected to continue to drift lower to 6.5% in 2016 and 6.2% in 2017, supported by demand stimulus. india’s growth rates are expected to hover near 7.5% this year and next, but many emerging market economies continue to lose momentum. the deep recessions in russia and brazil will persist, with brazil expected to contract by 4.3% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017.the outlook draws attention to a number of downside risks. most immediately, a united kingdom vote to leave the european union would trigger negative economic effects on the uk, other european countries and the rest of the world. brexit would lead to economic uncertainty and hinder trade growth, with global effects being even stronger if the british withdrawal from the eu triggers volatility in financial markets. by 2030, post-brexit uk gdp could be over 5% lower than if the country remained in the european union.“if we don’t take action to boost productivity and potential growth, both younger and older generations will be worse off,” said oecd chief economist catherine l mann. “the longer the global economy remains in this low-growth trap, the harder it will be for governments to meet fundamental promises. the consequences of policy inaction will be low career prospects for today’s youth, who have suffered so much already from the crisis, and lower retirement income for future pensioners.” ( watch the full presentation by oecd chief economist catherine l mann)the oecd highlights a series of policy requirements, including more comprehensive use of fiscal policy and revived structural reforms to break out of the low-growth trap.the outlook argues that reliance on monetary policy alone cannot deliver satisfactory growth and inflation. additional monetary policy easing could now prove to be less effective than in the past, and even counterproductive in some circumstances.many countries have room for fiscal policies to strengthen activity via public investment, especially as low long-term interest rates have effectively increased fiscal space. while almost all countries have scope to reallocate public spending towards more growth-friendly projects, collective action across economies to raise public investment in projects with a high growth impact would boost demand and improve fiscal sustainability.given the weak global economy and the backdrop of rising income inequality in many countries, more ambitious structural reforms – in particular targeting services sectors - can boost demand in the short-term and promote long-term improvements in employment, productivity growth and inclusiveness, the oecd said.for more information on the economic outlook, see: http://www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 97 00).

528@The twin challenges of promoting productivity and inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/twin-challenges-promoting-productivity-inclusive-growth.htm@advanced economies remain in the doldrums. people’s incomes are rising at a very low pace, especially in the lower half of the distribution. two global trends–the slowdown in productivity and the rise in inequality–reflect the state of policy, and point to the challenges policymakers face to change prospects for their citizens and the global economy.economies become more prosperous when output per worker rises. since the early 2000s, however, productivity growth has declined in many advanced countries. the slowdown in productivity–the oecd average slid from 2.0% in the 1990s to 1.4% in the 2000s–has been particularly pronounced since the global financial crisis struck in 2007. in fact, productivity growth has been lower in the last decade than at any time during the past 60 years. this deceleration pulls down the scope for stronger income gains.rising inequality reflects dampened income growth of many workers. since 1990, the income of the top 10% has grown 1.2% per year. contrast this with an annual income growth of 0.6% for the bottom 40% and an even more dismal 0.3% for the bottom 10%. the fruits of economic activity have been concentrated among higher earners, and flowed far less to median and lower earners. redistribution through taxes and transfers offset some of the rise in labour income inequality in the 1990s, but not in the 2000s. little wonder ordinary people have protested so loudly and in so many countries!what explains these two global trends? start with the productivity slowdown. the deceleration of productivity has been sharpest since the global financial crisis, when demand and investment have been very weak. for several economies, however, the productivity slowdown goes back to the early 2000s, and corresponds with other long-term trends of fewer start-ups, declining business dynamism, sluggish investment in knowledge-based capital, and a widening dispersion in productivity growth between the most innovative firms and the rest.what underpins rising inequality? on the high-income end, policies that inhibit competition and delay exit may have benefited employees in some lucrative firms, in finance and technology for instance. technological progress has probably pushed up the earnings of very skilled workers in particular. at the other end of the income spectrum, sluggish employment growth, along with reduced bargaining power, have curbed income growth of low-skilled workers.a closer look reveals that the slowdown in productivity and the rise in inequality have a third relation: a growing gap between the robust productivity growth of dynamic, frontier firms, who can pay more to their workers, and a much more lacklustre productivity performance among regular, traditional firms, who can afford to pay relatively less. we are still testing the precise nature of the three outcomes, including the extent to which there are common policy foundations.how might public policy respond? the policy choices–on monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural policies–affect both productivity and inequality. if coordinated and enacted coherently, they could act as levers to tackle the productivity slowdown and the rise in inequality together.aggressive demand management, through monetary and fiscal actions, can lift output, investment, and through those channels, productivity too. in many countries, the sluggish recovery in investment since the crisis has depressed productivity as well as undermined employment growth. since low-income, low-skilled workers often are the first to lose their job, slow growth exacerbates poverty and income disparities. slow growth also sends the signal to firms to reduce investments in finding new markets and developing new products, tempering productivity diffusion.public investment–in infrastructure, research, education–is a powerful policy lever and a pillar of economic progress. not only do these expenditures expand demand and create jobs today, but they can, by catalysing private activity, supporting innovation and improving skills, raise the long-term ability of the economy to grow and provide for the long-term needs of the citizens. since the crisis, many governments have reduced public investment, in part because their focus was on immediate fiscal consolidation. the very weak recovery and already strong reliance on monetary accommodation demands a renewed focus on fiscal policy and public investment. interest rates for sovereign debt obligations are now very low, so governments can borrow for public investments at unprecedentedly low rates. further, infrastructure is in a poor state in many countries, while the need for new infrastructure, in low-carbon energy supply for instance, is crucial to meet the climate-change crisis.structural policies need to go hand-in-hand with demand side policies to tackle productivity and inequality. many countries have, for instance, room to reallocate money to education, and indeed, our analysis indicates that increases in education spending, offset by savings elsewhere, are good for productivity and equality of income and opportunity. another example is stronger r&d collaboration between firms and universities, which can improve the diffusion of productivity gains from leading to lagging fi rms.reforms of product market regulation and bankruptcy legislation that ease barriers to firm entry and exit raise innovation and productivity. pro-competition reforms also tend to raise employment over time; although they can increase the chance of a job loss for lower-income workers they also increase the chance of getting a new job. lifelong learning, training and active labour market programmes have proven value in enabling people to skill up and find new jobs. packaging product market reforms with greater efforts to provide training and job-search support bears the promise of promoting productivity and reducing inequality, too.the banking and finance sector was a key conduit for the financial crisis. but it has also contributed to subsequent shortfalls in demand. in some markets, high financing costs have exacerbated the weakness in investment. faster write-downs of non-performing loans, rationalising the banking markets and, in some situations, bank recapitalisations would help improve the transmission of monetary policy stimulus into credit demand and investment. too-big-to-fail guarantees to large banks add to inequality. financial sector employees enjoy a wage premium compared with workers in other sectors. in europe, this financial wage premium is 25% of average earnings and reaches nearly 40% for top-paid workers.solving the productivity-inequality twin challenge requires coherent and comprehensive policy packages of demand and structural policies that take account of the existing institutional framework and policy settings that are unique to each country. even as each package deploys monetary and fiscal policy, and levers from each of the suite of structural policies (innovation and market competition, labour skills and adaptation, financial system structure and performance), there is no one-size fits all.andrews, d., c. criscuolo and p. gal (2015), “frontier firms, technology diffusion and public policy: micro evidence from oecd countries”, oecd productivity working papers, no 2, oecd publishing, parisdenk, o.

529@New OECD indicators trace productivity growth slowdown pre- and post- crisis@http://www.oecd.org/economy/newoecdindicatorstraceproductivitygrowthslowdownpre-andpost-crisis.htm@26/05/2016 - productivity growth – the central driver of rising economic output and material living standards – has been slowing in many advanced and emerging economies in the wake of the crisis, according to new data released today in the oecd compendium of productivity indicators.in most oecd countries the slowdown has cut across nearly all sectors, affecting both large and small firms alike, but has been particularly marked in those industries where new digital and technological innovations were expected to generate productivity dividends such as in the information, communication, finance and insurance sectors. ‌but the compendium also shows that the slowdown started well before the crisis, despite increased participation of firms in global value chains, rising education levels and technological innovations.the compendium looks at a broad range of possible explanations for this paradox and slowdown in labour productivity, characterised in large part, certainly pre-crisis, by slowing multifactor productivity (which comprises the contribution of technology, production techniques, knowledge gains and management practices).the compendium notes that a number of factors may be behind the paradox such as skills mismatches, sluggish investment, and declining business dynamism, particularly post crisis.investment in information and communication technology for example has fallen as a share of gdp in recent years in many countries, particularly in germany, sweden, japan and the us. while business dynamism, measured by start-up rates and the pace with which new firms displace less productive companies, has also slowed significantly in many oecd economies.the compendium also argues that although measuring productivity is complex, the paradox cannot be explained away by ‘mis-measurement’, particularly as the slowdown has occurred across a range of sectors, including manufacturing, where measurement challenges are not too onerous.slowing productivity growth has hit wages. this may exacerbate income and wealth inequalities, by trapping many workers in low productivity activities with high job insecurity, so creating a vicious circle. addressing the link between productivity and inequality will be at the heart of policy discussions at the oecd ministerial council meeting in paris on 1-2 june 2016.further information about oecd work on productivity – including studies prepared for discussion by oecd ministers at their june 2016 council meeting can be found at www.oecd.org/forum/issues/forum-2016-issues-inclusive-growth-and-productivity.htm.
530@Making growth more inclusive in Costa Rica@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlz4043b39w-en@in the past 30 years costa rica has grown steadily and social indicators have improved markedly. well-being indicators are comparable or even above the oecd average in several dimensions, such as health, environment or life-satisfaction. this paper reviews the social progress that costa rica has achieved and identifies reducing inequality and poverty as the main challenges. to tackle those challenges, the paper argues that there is a need to upgrade existing social assistance programmes to maximise their impact. social policies should put more emphasis on getting more people into formal work, including by raising their skill levels. this is the most effective way to get people out of poverty. education is the area where the largest gap with respect to oecd countries is observed. policy efforts are also warranted to tackle informality, which is increasing rapidly, and to close the gender gap in the labour market. the health and pension systems play a fundamental role in maintaining social cohesion in costa rica and it is crucial to modernise them and to make them sustainable in the face of demographic challenges. costa rica exemplifies the benefits of preserving natural resources in generating growth and employment opportunities, thereby providing a way out of poverty. building on its achievements in this area, costa rica should reinforce environmental protection efforts, such as reducing emissions from the transport sector and improving wastewater treatment.
531@How to boost export performance in Greece@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlz4046mz35-en@this paper analyses the structure of greek exports and presents policy recommendations to boost export performance. despite recent improvements, export performance deteriorated in the last decade particularly in the service sector. the decline in unit labour costs since the beginning of the crisis has restored cost competitiveness, but the response of exports has been sluggish due to severe liquidity constraints of exporters, lack of investment in export industries and in part because prices did not adjust as fast. greece is dominated by smes and specialised in low-technology goods which makes it difficult to be well integrated into global value chains. structural problems in product markets, barriers to exporting, access to finance and administrative burden affect competitiveness and impede export performance. boosting investment in infrastructure and logistics, further liberalising the network industries, improving investment in human and knowledge-based capital to allow upgrading in the global value chains will be essential to enhance export performance.
532@Structural reforms to boost inclusive growth in Greece@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlz404fx631-en@this paper takes stock of the main structural reforms that greece has undertaken since 2010, those currently proposed and that are in the process of implementation, and quantifies the medium and long‑term effects on output. special attention is given to three issues that are relevant to understanding reform dynamics in greece: i) the short-term impact of reforms; ii) the effect of some reforms on income inequality and other socioeconomic outcomes; iii) implementation problems that might undermine the ability of structural reforms to deliver their expected outcomes. the reforms, if fully implemented, could raise output by more than 13% over the next decade. reforms in product markets are particularly important in boosting growth. poverty and inequality have increased despite policies to mitigate the social impacts of greece’s deep depression since 2009. better social policies are needed to strengthen the social safety net and make growth more inclusive. much of the burden of adjustment has been borne by labour. labour market institutions should balance the objectives of increasing jobs, reallocating workers to where they can earn the most, and ensuring the fruits of the economic recovery are widely shared.

535@Hungarian economy expanding but reforms needed to boost skills, business investment and incomes@http://www.oecd.org/economy/hungarian-economy-expanding-but-reforms-needed-to-boost-skills-business-investment-and-incomes.htm@"6/5/2016 - the hungarian economy has expanded strongly in recent years, helped by robust exports and firm domestic demand. but incomes are among the lowest in the oecd and structural reforms will be needed to sustain growth over the medium term, strengthen business investment and better match skills to labour market needs, according to a new oecd report.the oecd economic survey of hungary says boosting business sector investment among small and medium-sized enterprises would help raise incomes and well-being by increasing the relatively low level of labour productivity.enabling workers to gain better skills that match labour market needs would also help improve productivity and allow more people to benefit from economic growth.the survey says unless there is reform to foster stronger business investment and a better match between the skills of workers and jobs there is little prospect of more robust, sustained growth as the working age population is declining. it also calls for improved regulatory transparency, less red tape and effective regulatory impact assessments.healthy business competition to foster competitive firms is being hampered by exemptions from the rules in some sectors. in agriculture, for instance, the ban on restrictive practices is not binding on local markets.the oecd says hungary’s education and training systems have not kept up with the rising demand for more technical skills as the economy has restructured. the survey says the promotion of life-long learning needs to be stepped up while more focus should be placed on effective training in the government’s public works schemes.relatively few women with young children have jobs. to increase the participation of women in the labour market, early childhood care needs to be expanded and incentives provided for paternity leave.although university enrolment has increased sharply, completion and graduation rates are among the lowest in the oecd. the government should increase funding of tertiary education and encourage stronger partnerships between universities and private companies to help more graduates get jobs for which they are qualified, the survey says.since 2008 the number of hungarians emigrating has tripled to 3% of the labour force and is contributing to shortages in some sectors such as health care. in addition, population ageing is more advanced in hungary than in many other oecd countries. the prime working age population is projected to fall to one of the smallest in europe as a share of total population in the coming decades, leading to high old age dependency ratios. in the long run the ageing population will be the main driver of public spending.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: www.oecd.org/hungary/economic-survey-hungary.htm. journalists are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.for further information on the economic survey of hungary, please contact the oecd media office (news.contact@oecd.org; +33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world."

537@Growing together: towards a more inclusive Ireland@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/growing-together_5jm0s927f5vk-en@the irish economy is growing strongly, but there is a risk many households will be left behind despite robust growth. high joblessness especially among the low-educated and skill-biased wage differentials have induced high market income inequality, among the highest in the oecd. ireland’s comprehensive welfare system provides a broad range of social benefits, which keeps jobless households out of poverty, but this reduces the financial incentives to work, especially for families with children. structural unemployment is also explained by the lack of skills required to find employment in the irish labour market, where the presence of multinational enterprises increases the reward for high skills and the penalty for poor skills. with the unemployed pool lacking the right skills and financial incentives, employers tend to resort to foreign workers, a practice facilitated by the well-functioning migration system. getting more people into work is important to share the benefits of the recovery as widely as possible. this requires building up work capacity, especially by improving jobseekers’ training, and ensuring welfare recipients honour their job path commitments in return. more needs to be done to increase incentive to work by reducing welfare and low-income traps. this should be done by shifting the tax burden from labour to indirect taxes in a progressive way that does not harm the lowest income groups.

538@To Brexit or not to Brexit: A Taxing Decision@http://www.oecd.org/economy/to-brexit-or-not-to-brexit-a-taxing-decision.htm@at the oecd, we advocate making policy decisions using evidence-based analysis. we advocate policies that improve the well-being of people. we advocate national policies that take due account of spillovers on the rest of the world. the uk is one of our founding members and one of our most active members. if it’s important for the uk, it’s important for the oecd.besides, an event of the scale of brexit has implications not only for the wellbeing of every british citizen, but for the people across the eu, the oecd and beyond. thus, at the oecd we are duty-bound to assess the possible consequences and flag the risks associated with this decision. i would also say, setting aside my oecd hat for a moment, that i have personal reasons for joining this debate. i came to britain for the first time in the early 70s, as a student at leeds university. it was a challenging time of miners’ strikes, 3-day working weeks, energy crises and electricity blackouts. i then came back, this time to london from 1976 to 1978, as mexico’s permanent delegate to the international coffee organisation. since then, over more than 40 years, i have witnessed first-hand the dramatic transformation of this country. the cosmopolitan britain that i see today, where my son and his wife live, work, pay taxes and raise and enjoy their own children, bears little resemblance to the more inward-looking society i first encountered before the united kingdom joined the european union. i will focus today on the economic aspects of britain’s membership of the european union. no time to dwell on the eu’s role in preserving peace in europe and spreading it around the world, as was recognised when the european union was awarded the nobel peace prize in 2012. it is not the occasion either to elaborate on the eu’s leadership role in environmental issues and their crucial contribution to the success of cop21. nick stern, who kindly invited me here today, is the very embodiment of the influence the uk had in that success. nor do i need to belabour the eu’s virtue as perhaps the greatest exponent of soft power in the world. neighbouring countries queue up to join the european union, drawn by the example of its stable, peaceful, prosperous and democratic societies. certainly no one would claim that the eu is a finished product. the scaffolding is not easy on the eye but the structures being built behind it eventually become a source of admiration and collective strength, once the scaffolding is removed. being part of this constant work in progress, of this worthy and visionary project, with its vocation for permanent change, reinvention and institutional innovation, makes the uk stronger. why would anyone want to give up this truly win-win proposition?brexit, on the contrary, could threaten both the unity of the uk, because of scotland’s expressed desire to remain part of the eu, as well as the unity of the eu itself, because of the likelihood of other countries believing that there is merit in following the uk’s example.being a member of the european union has been good for the uk. since the united kingdom joined the european union in 1973, its gdp per capita has doubled. this is not only more than in the other major eu member states, but also more than in english-speaking countries that are not eu members. more than the united states, canada, australia and new zealand. look at another english-speaking country, ireland, which joined the eu at the same time. its gdp per capita has quadrupled since 1973! the evidence over the past four decades suggests that, far from holding back growth, harnessing the potential of the european single market enhances living standards.let’s now turn to the future and to the question the british people will have to answer in two months’ time.the brexit referendum: a taxing questionthe question posed in the referendum, “should the united kingdom remain a member of the european union or leave the european union?” is a taxing one. taxing in the sense that its consequences are complex and permanent, not only for the uk but also for the rest of the eu and even beyond. so the responsibility borne by british voters on june 23rd is very serious indeed. it will be an act of intergenerational responsibility.but also taxing because brexit would, rather like a tax, hit the wellbeing and the pockets of uk citizens. unlike most taxes, however, this one will not finance the provision of public services or close the fiscal gap. the “brexit tax” would be a pure deadweight loss, a cost incurred with no economic benefit. and this tax would not be a one-off levy. britons would be paying it for many years. the oecd has estimated the scale of this brexit tax for uk households. the details of the relevant criteria and calculations are included in the report that we have distributed to you this morning (download the report).we are aware of the analysis the uk treasury produced last week with the same purpose. the lse’s centre for economic performance has also produced excellent research on the matter. and there is also the report commissioned by the confederation of british industries. at the end of our report there is a comparison of the four calculations. there are, of course, some differences in the numbers coming out of these different efforts. sometimes it is a matter of different time horizons, or variations in assumptions about post-brexit trading arrangements. different models can be employed, and research findings drawn from different sources will lead to different estimated costs. but the results are quantitatively similar and qualitatively the same: the uk would be worse off under brexit.and our estimates are too cautious. for one thing, they focus entirely on future effects, whereas in fact the first payments of the “brexit tax” are already being made. just this morning, the office for national statistics announced the lowest quarterly gdp growth figures since 2012. and already in the previous quarter, business investment was weak as the brexit issue gained prominence. brexit costs can also be seen in financial markets. since the autumn, the pound has weakened against the euro and the dollar, and the cost of insuring against exchange rate volatility has risen significantly. the costs are piling up, and we are still two months away from the referendum!the economic effects of brexit: the oecd’s estimatenear-term effects our analysis looks at the effects of a decision to leave the eu over two horizons. from the moment of a brexit vote until the arrangements for “divorce” are definitively settled -- years later -- there would be heightened economic uncertainty, with damaging consequences. brexit would lead to a sell-off of assets and a sharp rise in risk premia. consumer confidence would fall, as would business confidence and investment, thus holding back growth. were the united kingdom to leave the eu, it would have to negotiate new trading relationships. brexit would mean that the uk would not only give up full and automatic access to the single market, but would also lose the benefit of trade agreements covering 53 markets that it currently enjoys and which it helped shape. supporters of brexit argue that the uk would actually achieve a more liberal trade regime outside the eu than it enjoys now. but this is a delusion. bilateral and regional trade agreements take years to negotiate and absorb substantial energy and resources. the united kingdom would be starting from scratch. the first priority would be to negotiate with the rest of the european union, which accounts for nearly half of uk exports. facing an embittered, freshly-rejected and much larger partner with an incentive to make exit costly, is not a good basis for a favourable outcome. regarding non-eu trading partners, as president obama reminded us last week, the uk on its own would not be exactly their top priority for negotiating trade deals or granting generous trade concessions. the rewards for potential partners would have considerably shrunk.taking into account the effects of heightened uncertainty and the less favourable trading environment while new arrangements are negotiated, we put the “brexit tax” at some 2200 pounds per household by 2020.  longer-term effectsover the longer term, the supply side of the british economy would also be negatively affected by brexit. without full access to the single market, the lure of the uk, which currently receives the largest inflows of foreign direct investment in europe, would wane. some foreign businesses that set up here to access the european market could even decide to relocate. the same would apply to many british multinationals. the negative impact on net fdi would hit total investment, innovation and productivity and would also aggravate the adverse trade effects. bear in mind also that well over two million uk citizens benefit greatly from the freedom to live, work and study anywhere in the eu. these are some of the freedoms that we should not take for granted. this is a particularly relevant issue for those of who already see yourselves as british, europeans and citizens of the world. that would be put in jeopardy by brexit. less investment, reduced flows of goods and people, costlier credit and lower exposure to ideas and skills across borders would ultimately undermine productivity and the long-run economic capacity of the uk economy. we estimate that in a brexit scenario, gdp per household in 2030 would be lower than the baseline by at least 3200 pounds and up to 5000 pounds in the most pessimistic case.while no one knows precisely what the costs would be, what is striking about our estimates and those produced by most others is that all the numbers under a brexit case are negative. the best outcome under brexit is still worse than remaining an eu member, while the worst outcomes are very bad indeed. the brexit tax just gets bigger. we see no economic upside for the uk whatsoever. the only question is where, on the spectrum of possible losses, the outcome winds up. the bigger question is why spend so much wealth, well-being, time, energy and talent in order to compensate the damage of a bad decision when you can simply avoid taking such decisions. why spend so much effort trying to recover the benefits of membership in a club you don’t have to leave?some are invoking the question of the uk’s sovereignty. but they are invoking a false dichotomy. it is not about the uk being sovereign or not. all countries take decisions on whether to pool their sovereignty depending on the issues involved. the uk does this as a member of nato, the oecd, the imf, the world bank, the ilo and ultimately the united nations. taken to the extreme, it would have to leave all these institutions in the quest for “sovereignty”. in reality, the uk, like other countries, weighs the costs of membership against the benefits. sovereignty is not lost. it is simply used wisely. as a part of the eu, the uk always retains the right to withdraw from the eu, but it leverages its sovereignty to shape a europe more aligned with the interests of the united kingdom itself. such was the case of the deal struck by prime minister cameron last february. if the uk chooses to give up the opportunity to help steer europe in the right direction, it would be doing so at its own peril.ladies and gentlemen,we recognise that economic considerations are not the only rationale for voting to remain or exit, and it is for the british people to weigh the different pros and cons. the late lord ralf dahrendorf put it very clearly when he said “for the resolution of conflict by negotiation, and for engendering a habit of peaceful co-operation, the european union is seen by many as a model. and britain must be part of that model.” it already is and there’s every reason to stay.our conclusion is unequivocal. the uk is much stronger as a part of europe, and europe is much stronger with the uk as a driving force. there is no upside for the uk in brexit. only costs that can be avoided and advantages to be seized by remaining in europe. no one should have to pay the brexit tax.thank you!
539@OECD study finds Britons will be paying a heavy “Brexit tax” for many years if UK leaves EU@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-study-finds-britons-will-be-paying-a-heavy-brexit-tax-for-many-years-if-uk-leaves-eu.htm@27/04/2016 - a uk exit from the eu would immediately hit confidence and raise uncertainty which would result in gdp being 3% lower by 2020, which equates to gbp 2200 per household. the oecd states that such costs are already piling up in a new study released today.the projected hit to living standards would amount in effect to a permanent “brexit tax” on households, the oecd says. presenting the analysis in a speech at the london school of economics, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “leaving europe would impose a brexit tax on generations to come. instead of funding public services, this tax would be a pure deadweight loss, with no economic benefit.”the uk would suffer from the loss of unrestricted access to the single market. it would also face new barriers in many of the third-country markets to which preferential access was lost as a result of leaving the eu, even if it succeeded in negotiating a new trade arrangement with europe. an important risk is that capital inflows would be disrupted, leading to a jarring contraction of the uk’s record-high current account deficit of 7% of gdp.a decision by britain to leave the european union would cause a severe negative shock to the economy and weaken gdp growth for many years, equivalent to a cost per household of gbp 3200 per year by 2030 at today’s prices, and as much as gbp 5000 in the worst case scenario according the new oecd study. being outside the eu would further damage trade, foreign direct investment and productivity, according to the study.the longer-term effects of weaker technical progress, migration and capital caused by brexit are projected according to three scenarios: optimistic, central and pessimistic. in the optimistic projection the negative impact on gdp is around 2.7% by 2030, but in the pessimistic scenario it would be more than 7.5%. in the central scenario uk gdp would be more than 5% below what would be expected if the country remained in the eu. this gdp shortfall is equivalent to gbp 3200 per household.net transfers to the eu budget are relatively small, at 0.3% - 0.4% of gdp per annum in the years ahead, and the saving from a reduction in these transfers would be more than offset by the impact of slower gdp growth on the fiscal position. it is estimated that by 2019 the budget deficit would be higher by 0.9 percentage points of gdp.the study also notes that the estimated costs of brexit do not take into account the fact that remaining in the eu could lead to additional gdp growth as further development of the single market boosts trade and foreign direct investment.more information on the economic consequences of brexit: a taxing decision is available at: www.oecd.org/economy/the-economic-consequences-of-brexit-a-taxing-decision.htm. the full pdf of the report is available here.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (tel. + 33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
540@Labour market transitions in Italy: job separation, re-employment and policy implications@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm0s95j78s1-en@italy’s low employment rate is associated with adverse labour market dynamics characterised differently across different categories of people. both job separation and re-employment have remained less frequent in italy, especially among older workers, against the backdrop of rigid employment protection legislation which weighs down job creation, thus re-employment prospects. working conditions after re-employment tend to worsen, especially for older workers, as seniority is not entirely portable across firms. prospects on working conditions after re-employment deteriorate with longer unemployment spells, affecting incentives to return to work, especially where social benefits are too generous. rigid employment protection for incumbent workers has also come at the cost of more frequent labour turnover for temporary workers who face an increasing risk of unemployment, including the more highly educated. the risk of hysteresis effects is significant in particular for those who separated from temporary jobs. the public employment service has to take account of individual cases, adopting intensive programmes such as training where necessary, while in general personalised job search assistance to get jobseekers back to work at early stages is recommended.
541@Chile: better skills for inclusive growth@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/chile-better-skills-for-inclusive-growth_5jm0xdwm456l-en@improving education and skills is the linchpin to reduce income inequality and boost productivity growth. this paper argues that to improve, and make better use of, the skills of the labour force, chile could gain a lot from a comprehensive and consistent skills strategy along three pillars: developing, activating and using skills effectively. chile has made tremendous progress over the last decades attracting more students to the education system. yet, educational outcomes remain below oecd standards, and are strongly linked to students’ socio-economic status. improving the quality and equity of education would help achieve stronger productivity growth and make chile a more inclusive country. therefore, chile should set the goal of attaining universal skills by 2030. reaching this goal requires investing more in early childhood education, making schools more inclusive and reshaping teacher careers. chile also needs to improve access to quality tertiary education for students from medium and low socio-economic backgrounds. finally, in terms of activating and using skills effectively, a key goal should be to reduce skill mismatch, which contributes to low productivity growth. this requires more flexible labour markets, investing more in vocational education and training, and promoting the participation of more women in the fields of engineering and computer science. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of chile (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/ economic-survey-chile.htm).

546@Addressing the challenges in higher education in Norway@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/addressing-the-challenges-in-higher-education-in-norway_5jm0xf28vw8s-en@norway’s predominately public and tuition-fee free tertiary education system encourages participation and has high attainment rates. however, challenges in spending efficiency, study times, skills demand, inclusiveness and quality remain. also, learning outcomes could improve further. moreover, few norwegian universities rank high in international comparisons on the basis of research-related and other indicators, and spending per student or gdp is relatively high. many small institutions, aiming to meet regional needs, do not reach critical mass in staff and student numbers. many students take considerable time to finish their studies despite financial incentives, and students from lower income groups have low tertiary participation and completion rates despite a strong focus on inclusiveness. enrolments remain low in fields such as science and engineering, although they have increased in recent years, and supply shortages in some professional areas indicate room for improvement. better incentives for both students and institutions to ensure timely completions, with a special emphasis on disadvantaged students and labour market needs, a structure that paves the way for adequately sized institutions, and effective governance are essential for higher quality education and research. effective monitoring of the outcomes is also vital. the government’s comprehensive quality-enhancing agenda, with a focus on these fronts, is welcome. this working paper relates to the 2016 oecd economic survey of norway (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-norway.htm).
547@Germany: Boost investment and productivity for a stronger economy and more inclusive society@http://www.oecd.org/economy/germany-boost-investment-and-productivity-for-a-stronger-economy-and-more-inclusive-society.htm@5/4/2016 - germany is in a solid economic position, but ageing and technological change require new investments in people to ensure a stronger and more inclusive society, according to the latest oecd economic survey of germany.the survey, presented in berlin today by oecd secretary-general angel gurría, highlights germany’s robust recovery and high levels of competitiveness since the global economic crisis. it also points out the wide range of challenges facing the country as it seeks to strengthen productivity, boost well-being in a rapidly ageing society and ensure the integration of newly-arrived migrants.more investment will be key to raise productivity and living standards. fostering investment in knowledge-based capital and unleashing the potential of key services would also strengthen the competitiveness of manufacturing, facilitating the transition to “industry 4.0.” investing in key education, the lifelong skills development of german employees, on social services as well as boosting public investment in poor municipalities would also enhance inclusive growth, according to the survey. there is scope to improve efficiency in identifying and implementing municipal investment projects.steps to eliminate regulatory biases that hold back the reallocation of resources would boost productivity and investment. the survey points out that there is particular scope to raise productivity in services through regulatory reform. improving governance or further privatising government stakes in important businesses would also help.“despite the turbulence in the world economy, the german economy remains robust, with strong export performance and low unemployment,” mr gurría said. “germany must use its position of strength to prepare for the future, notably by ensuring the successful integration of the wave of refugees who have been offered asylum. these population inflows are an opportunity to counter demographic trends and lay the basis for a more diversified and productive economy.” the survey underlines that effective integration policies for the newly arrived immigrants will be critical for germany to improve economic outcomes and ensure social cohesion. this requires up-front spending on training and language skills. giving access to the labour market more quickly to all refugees who are likely to stay and boosting active labour market programmes will also be necessary.germany has implemented far-reaching labour market reforms in the past, but it can do more to eliminate the barriers for women to develop their professional careers, which would boost well-being and incomes substantially. this should include greater investment in childcare, early childhood education and full-day schooling, and lowering the high tax burden on household’s second earners that discourages many women from working full-time. the introduction of a separate tax-free allowance for second earners would improve incentives to work.indexing the statutory retirement age would improve the sustainability of the pension system, the survey says. as the retirement age needs to go up, coverage of disability risks could be improved. there is also scope for further reforms to remove barriers to employment - and well-being - of older workers. barriers for older workers to combine pension receipt with employment can be removed and the prevention of health risks at higher age could become more effective.

549@Lithuania: Achieving stronger and more inclusive growth will require new reforms@http://www.oecd.org/economy/lithuania-achieving-stronger-and-more-inclusive-growth-will-require-new-reforms.htm@15/03/16 - lithuania has made remarkable economic and social progress, but further policy reforms will be necessary to ensure a more productive and inclusive economy, according to the first-ever oecd economic assessment of lithuania.the assessment, presented in vilnius today by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and prime minister of lithuania algirdas butkevičius, underlines the country’s successful economic development over the past 25 years, as well as its robust resilience to external shocks, which allowed it to bounce back from the global economic crisis quicker and faster than most of its european union partners. the assessment also underlines, however, the serious challenges that must still be overcome to boost productivity and bring about further convergence of living standards for all citizens with other advanced economies.“the lithuanian economy has bounced back from the crisis and is expected to gain momentum, despite the weak global recovery,” mr gurría said. “deft management of the post-crisis economy has delivered strong growth, declining unemployment and improving public finances. despite these considerable achievements, further reforms will be needed to bring about a more productive and more inclusive economy for the benefit of all lithuanians.” (read the full speech)the oecd economic assessment of lithuania feeds into the country’s ongoing oecd accession process, which was launched in april 2015. it aims to contribute to the design and implementation of reforms that will help lithuania to continue modernising its economy while improving living standards for all. to ensure continuing advances in income and wellbeing, the assessment calls for new reforms to boost productivity, which is one-third below the oecd average.the main priorities should be to improve the education system, by increasing the role of workplace training and attracting talented people to the teaching profession, to enhance the governance of state-owned enterprises, to further develop infrastructure and to further promote innovation, notably by ensuring that the overall policy framework supports the growth of young innovative firms.the government can also do more to reduce informality, which would both improve tax collection and level the playing field to support the growth of the most productive firms.according to the assessment, reforms for bringing about a stronger economy go hand-in-hand with efforts to reduce poverty, which affects one in five lithuanians. they would also make lithuania a more inclusive society, notably for low-skilled workers and the unemployed. a wider access to lifelong learning for the low-skilled and the planned movement toward a “flexicurity” model, with streamlined labour market regulations combined with greater income support in case of job loss, should expand opportunities and share prosperity more widely. building up the capacity of public employment services, to get people back to work, and strengthening the minimum income support to the poor, are both equally critical. the report welcomes the “new social model” reform package and also calls on the government to promote healthy lifestyles and a stronger primary health care system.the assessment was presented in vilnius during an official visit of the oecd secretary-general, organised to advance lithuania’s accession process to the organisation. the visit includes meetings with president dalia grybauskaitė, prime

roadmap, which sets out the terms, conditions and process for its accession to the organization. the accession roadmap calls for a series of in-depth reviews conducted by 23 oecd technical committees, which, in turn, will provide a formal opinion to the oecd council on lithuania’s willingness and ability to implement oecd standards, and of its policies and practices as compared to oecd best policies and practices in the relevant area.these reviews are seen as an opportunity to support the lithuanian authorities in pushing forward reforms consistent with oecd standards and best practices.

550@Tougher environmental laws do not hurt export competitiveness – OECD study@http://www.oecd.org/economy/tougher-environmental-laws-do-not-hurt-export-competitiveness.htm@10/3/16 - countries that implement stringent environmental policies do not lose export competitiveness when compared against countries with more moderate regulations, according to a new oecd study that examines trade in manufactured goods between advanced and emerging economies.the findings suggest that emerging economies with strong manufacturing sectors like china could strengthen environmental laws without denting their overall share in export markets. high-pollution or energy-intensive industries like chemicals, plastics and steel making, whether in the briics or in europe or north america, would suffer a small disadvantage from a further tightening of regulations, but this would be compensated by growth in exports from less-polluting activities.do environmental policies affect global value chains? challenges the conventional wisdom that regulations to curb pollution and energy use hurt businesses by creating new costs. the so-called pollution haven hypothesis suggests that tightening environmental laws often prompts manufacturers to simply relocate some production stages to countries with laxer regulations.“environmental policies are simply not the major driver of international trade patterns,” said oecd chief economist catherine l. mann, presenting the study at the london school of economics. “we find no evidence that a large gap between the environmental policies of two given countries significantly affects their overall trade in manufactured goods. governments should stop working on the assumption that tighter regulations will hurt their export share and focus on the edge they can get from innovation.”environmental policy has only a small impact on trade growththe new oecd study analyses historic export data in high and low pollution industries in 23 advanced countries and six emerging economies. it takes the domestic value added in export data and uses an oecd environmental policy stringency indicator that ranks countries according to more or less stringent policies.it shows that countries with stringent environmental laws suffer a very small disadvantage in pollution-intensive sectors such as steel-making, chemicals, plastics and fuel products. this is compensated by an edge gained in cleaner industries like machinery or electronics. both effects are tiny compared to factors including market size, the lifting of trade tariffs, globalisation and a country’s intrinsic assets.for example, domestic value added in exports of goods from high-pollution industries from the most environmentally stringent countries (denmark, germany and switzerland) to the briics rose by usd 11.157 billion from 1995 to 2008. that figure would have been 3% percent higher if green laws weren’t so stringent, yet the same stringent laws boosted exports in cleaner industries by 3% - almost the same amount in dollars.countries where manufacturers already pollute less should therefore gain global market share as tougher domestic laws are put in place. industries and firms that become cleaner over time will prosper under more stringent policies, but those that fail to adapt will see their export performance erode.as governments consider ways to tighten environmental regulations in line with new climate change pledges, this analysis offers evidence that doing so would not hurt trade. it bears out theoretical studies showing that factors like market conditions and workforce quality are likely to have much more impact on trade competitiveness. tough environmental standards may also drive firms to become more innovative, improving both their economic and environmental performance.the oecd environmental policy stringency indicator is a composite index based on the explicit or implicit cost of environmental policies related mainly to climate and air pollution. it shows policies have become increasingly stringent in advanced economies since the 1990s, with the highest costs on polluting behaviour in denmark, germany, the netherlands and switzerland and the uk and us around average. policies are more lenient in the briics.you can download do environmental policies affect global value chains? here.the brochure how stringent are environmental policies? can be found here.for further information, journalists should contact catherine bremer in the oecd media office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
551@Do environmental policies affect global value chains? A new perspective on the pollution haven hypothesis@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm2hh7nf3wd-en@increasing international fragmentation of production has reinforced fears that industrial activity may flee to countries with laxer environmental policies – in line with the so-called pollution haven hypothesis (phh). if phh effects are strong, domestic responses to environmental challenges may prove ineffective or meet strong resistance. using a gravity model of bilateral trade in manufacturing industries for selected oecd and briics countries over 1990s-2000s, this paper studies how exports are related to national environmental policies. environmental policies are not found to be a major driver of international trade patterns, but have some significant effects on specialisation. more stringent domestic policies have no significant effect on overall trade in manufactured goods, but are linked to a comparative disadvantage in “dirty” industries, and a corresponding advantage in “cleaner” industries. the effects are stronger for the domestic component of exports than for gross exports, yet notably smaller than the effects of e.g. trade liberalisation.
552@Tackling poverty and inequality in Greece is crucial to recovery from crisis@http://www.oecd.org/economy/tackling-poverty-and-inequality-in-greece-is-crucial-to-recovery-from-crisis.htm@10/3/16 - boosting economic growth and investment to create jobs, improve the stability of public finances and provide an effective social safety net are crucial to help greece recover from the profound social costs of the economic crisis, says the oecd in its latest report.the economic survey of greece says poverty has risen since the crisis to reach one third of the population. tackling poverty and inequality must be urgent policy priorities, it adds.the survey sees the recovery strengthening in 2017 as ongoing reforms and external demand benefit investment and jobs. it stresses that successful negotiations to address public debt sustainability are critical to improve the outlook. however, major risks remain. not only could the credit crunch continue to undermine domestic demand but weak activity could be compounded by a slowdown in global trade and softer growth in the rest of the euro area, the destination of a third of greek exports. the survey adds that the refugee crisis could pose major problems for the greek economy, particularly if the eu contribution turns out to be insufficient. preliminary estimates put the cost of the influx of refugees at around 0.4% of gdp in 2015.presenting the survey in athens, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “greece has gone through a painful adjustment and it’s still facing a challenging economic and social outlook. thus the country needs to recover growth to address such challenges. reforms are starting to bear fruit, it is now essential to improve implementation, increase greek “ownership” and focus efforts on both social wellbeing and competitiveness. the oecd will continue to stand by the greek government, providing expertise and support to help greece promote more inclusive and sustainable growth.” (read the full speech)a targeted guaranteed minimum income scheme for poor households is due to be fully implemented in 2017 but the survey says further action is needed to tackle increasing rates of child poverty. among its recommendations, the oecd says a subsidised school meals programme should be introduced in poor regions. establishing a social housing programme should be a medium-term goal, but in the meantime, well-targeted assistance is needed to tackle homelessness and the high cost of accommodation.financing such social programmes would represent around 1.5% of gdp. resources will need to be reallocated from savings generated elsewhere, such as from pensions, defence or improvements in tax collection, according to the survey. the pension reform should focus on better aligning contributions and benefits, reducing special regimes and alleviating the burden on the most vulnerable.more investment, for instance in infrastructure and logistics, would support exports which are essential to a sustained recovery. liberalising further the network industries would also give the quality and quantity of investments a boost. eu structural funds should be used more effectively to increase investment in education, research, and innovation, as well as in information and communication technology to help improve skills.the report says the adjustment process has so far depended too heavily on fiscal measures and labour markets while not enough progress has been made on product market reforms. product market reforms, introduced since the crisis, have advanced only slowly, and have been undermined by weak implementation and largely left monopoly power in place. enhancing administrative capacity, stronger ownership of the policy changes and clear communication about the expected benefits to the general public, would improve the effectiveness of the new reform programme.tax evasion remains widespread in greece, thus reducing revenues needed to support social policies. the oecd calls for a broadening of the tax base while the tax administration should be strengthened and given more autonomy, allowing it to free up resources for audits and improved enforcement.weak economic growth and bank recapitalisation needs have pushed up greece’s already high public debt. reaching an agreement with creditors on significantly extending maturities and repayment grace periods could assure low and stable gross finance needs over the long-term and reduce uncertainty, the survey says.an embeddable version of the economic survey is available together with information about downloadable and print versions of the report.overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: http://www.oecd.org/greece/economic-survey-greece.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.for further information on the economic survey, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
553@The drivers of public health spending: integrating policies and institutions@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm2f76rnhkj-en@this paper investigates the impact of policies and institutions on health expenditures for a large panel of oecd countries for the period 2000-10. we use a set of 20 policy and institutional indicators developed by the oecd characterising the main supply-side, demand-side, and public management, coordination and financing features of health systems. the impact of these indicators is tested alongside control variables related to demographic (dependency ratio) and non-demographic (income, prices and technology) drivers of health expenditures per capita. overall, there is a reasonably good fit between the expected signs of the coefficients for the institutional indicators and the actual estimates. by integrating the role of policies and institutions, together with the other primary determinants, our analysis is able to explain most of the cross-country variation in public health expenditures.
554@Monetary policy and inequality@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm2hz2x9hxr-en@this paper analyses two-way interactions between monetary policy and inequality in selected advanced economies. in the context of a highly accommodative monetary stance over recent years, the analysis focuses on the effects of monetary policy on inequality over the business cycle via its impacts on returns on assets, the cost of debt servicing and asset prices. while monetary policy easing has a priori ambiguous effects on income and net wealth inequality, in practice these effects are estimated to be small. cross-country differences in the size and distribution of income and net wealth explain contrasting effects. a house price increase generally reduces net wealth inequality, while the opposite is true for increases in equity and bond prices. higher inequality can reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy stimulus in boosting private consumption, but such effects are estimated to be small. cross-country differences in the size and composition of household financial assets rather than in their distribution are more relevant for differences in the effectiveness of monetary policy, especially via the wealth channel.
555@Global economy urgently needs a stronger and more coherent policy response to promote robust and inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/global-economy-urgently-needs-a-stronger-and-more-coherent-policy-response-to-promote-robust-and-inclusive-growth.htm@"26/02/2016 - policymakers need to deploy broad-based reform plans that incorporate monetary, fiscal, and structural policies to stimulate persistently weak demand, re-launch productivity growth, create jobs and build a more inclusive global economy, according to the oecd’s annual going for growth report.going for growth 2016 offers a comprehensive assessment of how government policy reforms affect economic performance and their citizens’ well-being. it identifies new priorities to revive growth and underscores the importance of synergies among policies in designing reform programmes.this year’s edition of going for growth shows that a slowdown in the pace of reforms first observed in the 2013-14 period continued during 2015, notably in advanced economies, but also in emerging ones. new reforms are aimed at improving educational outcomes and lifting the labour force participation of women. but not enough is being done to boost innovation or streamline product and labour market regulation, which are critical aspects of today’s productivity and equity challenges. “the worrying slowdown in the global economy calls out for an urgent and comprehensive policy response, drawing on all the monetary, fiscal and structural policy levers at governments’ disposal,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said.“given the breadth and evolving nature of the growth and inclusiveness challenges facing advanced and emerging economies, the slowdown in the pace of structural reforms is a serious concern. greater ambition on structural reforms can help bring about better conditions for investment and innovation, leading to higher productivity, better quality jobs and a more inclusive approach to the pursuit of growth that benefits all segments of society.”going for growth 2016 makes the case for prioritising growth-enhancing measures that can best support demand in the short term, combining structural policies targeted toward regulatory reform with investment in public infrastructure. “today’s exceptionally low interest rates improve governments’ fiscal space, affording a unique opportunity to make investments in infrastructure that will boost demand, stoke growth and actually improve public finances,” mr gurría said. “choosing the right projects, combined with structural reforms, will generate higher multipliers on economic activity. this can re-launch growth while lowering the debt-to-gdp ratio, opening additional space for policies aimed at creating a more inclusive society.""presenting going for growth 2016 with chinese finance minister lou jiwei, ahead of the g20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors taking place in shanghai, mr. gurría said the report’s reform recommendations, tailored for each country, could boost growth in oecd and g20 countries alike. the recipe for reform varies by country, but the ingredients include improving product market competition, labour market flexibility, financial market resilience and tackling barriers to cross-border trade and investment. the going for growth analysis forms the basis of the oecd’s wider contribution to the g20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. the oecd works with g20 countries to quantify their efforts to fulfil a pledge made during the 2014 leaders’ summit in brisbane to boost their combined gdp by 2% over the coming five years, and to achieve their national growth strategy objectives.going for growth 2016 notes that the pace of reforms has varied both across countries and policy areas. among the highlights:• the slowdown in the pace of reform observed over the 2013-14 period has continued in 2015, even after taking into account measures that are in the pipeline but that have yet to be fully implemented.• in europe, southern european countries —in particular italy and spain— have more reform achievement than northern european countries, which were less impacted by the global economic crisis.• outside europe, countries where a relatively high number of measures related to going for growth recommendations have been taken include japan, among advanced economies, and china, india and mexico, in the case of emerging economies.• relatively more actions are being taken to lift the labour force participation of women and to improve educational outcomes, while fewer actions are observed in innovation policy, public sector efficiency or product and labour market regulation.• in countries where income inequality is a particular concern, the majority of reform actions taken would help to narrow the income distribution.further information on going for growth

556@Raising public spending efficiency in Switzerland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm3rxpwrgjf-en@despite having low government spending, switzerland scores highly in various public policy outcomes, including health, education and transportation. but, as the population grows and ages, efficiency of public spending will have to rise to maintain low tax rates. given its high returns, the provision of early childhood education and care should be boosted, especially for children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, including those from immigrant families. cantons should avoid oversupplying baccalaureates, thereby lowering university dropout rates. policies will also need to adapt to structural changes in the labour market, by boosting the supply and attractiveness of fields of study that are facing high demand on the labour market, and by further clarifying study streams across tertiary education. health-care efficiency could be raised by further developing managed-care networks. enforcing systematic data collection for the quality of care would also help patients and providers make better informed choices. generic drugs’ prices are too high due to a poorly designed price-fixing mechanism. transportation suffers from congestion that could be reduced by implementing peak-load pricing on roads and trains. but efficiency in public spending is also about allocating public funds optimally. switzerland’s rapidly rising social security entitlements and its fiscal equalisation system constrain public spending and risk crowding out important expenditures. fast-rising social security entitlements could be addressed via indexing the retirement age to life expectancy. fiscal equalisation weakens tax-raising incentives for some cantons; this could be addressed by allowing them to keep a larger part of their increased revenues. efficiency in allocating public expenditure could also be raised by increasing the share of public spending allocated by tender and harmonising procurement regulations across all levels of government. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic review of switzerland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm)
557@Policies to tame the housing cycle in Switzerland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm3scgb48d4-en@since 2000, real estate prices in switzerland have risen rapidly. by some measures, between 2000 and 2014 apartment prices almost doubled, while those of single-family homes increased by around 60%. price rises have varied considerably across cantons. transactions activity in the sector has been robust, with growth in mortgage volumes strongly outpacing disposable income. as a consequence, switzerland’s residential mortgage debt-to-gdp ratio, at 120%, is the highest in the oecd. this is despite a private ownership rate of only around 40%, one of the lowest in the oecd. banks’ exposure to the mortgage market is the sixth highest in the oecd, with mortgages making up over 80% of domestic (non-interbank) bank loans. that said, high house prices are being supported by very low interest rates, immigration-fuelled population growth and smaller family units, while demand is being bolstered by mortgage interest tax deductibility and institutional investors. restrictive planning regulations have also damped the supply response. these factors have contributed to low rental yields, although high compared to other assets and very low vacancy rates. a number of measures have been taken by banks and authorities over the past three years to shore up banks’ exposure and to take the heat out of the market. these include a minimum down payment of 10% of the collateral value of the property from the borrower’s own funds, which may not be obtained by pledging or early withdrawal of second-pillar pension assets, and compulsory amortisation of loans. a counter-cyclical buffer (ccb) was activated at the beginning of 2013 and obliges banks to hold additional common equity tier 1 capital based on their risk-weighted mortgage positions secured by residential real estate in switzerland. in january 2014, the ccb was increased from 1% to 2%. despite these measures, house prices remain high and the risk to the banking sector elevated. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic review of switzerland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm)
558@Public spending efficiency in the OECD: benchmarking health care, education and general administration@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jm3st732jnq-en@in many oecd countries changes in demography and health conditions are putting pressure on public finance. to prevent further expansion of government spending as a percentage of gdp, public spending efficiency will need to be raised. this paper uses data envelopment analysis (dea) to assess the efficiency of welfare spending in a sample of oecd countries around 2012, focussing on health care, secondary education and general public services. the dea model has a two input-one output structure, with at least one of the variables representing a composite indicator controlling for country-specific factors (socio-economic environment and life-style factors, for example). we find wide dispersion in efficiency measures across oecd countries and provide possible quantified improvements for both output and input efficiency.
559@Elusive global growth outlook requires urgent policy response@http://www.oecd.org/economy/elusive-global-growth-outlook-requires-urgent-policy-response.htm@"18/02/2016-achieving strong growth in the global economy remains elusive, with only a modest recovery in advanced economies and slower activity in emerging markets, according to the oecd’s latest interim economic outlook.the world economy is likely to expand no faster in 2016 than in 2015, its slowest pace in five years. trade and investment are weak. sluggish demand is leading to low inflation and inadequate wage and employment growth. the downgrade in the global outlook since the previous economic outlook in november 2015 is broadly based, spread across both advanced and major emerging economies, with the largest impacts expected in the united states, the euro area and economies reliant on commodity exports, like brazil and canada. financial instability risks are substantial, as demonstrated by recent falls in equity and bond prices worldwide, and increasing vulnerability of some emerging economies to volatile capital flows and the effects of high domestic debt.“global growth prospects have practically flat-lined, recent data have disappointed and indicators point to slower growth in major economies, despite the boost from low oil prices and low interest rates,” said oecd chief economist catherine l. mann. “given the significant downside risks posed by financial sector volatility and emerging market debt, a stronger collective policy approach is urgently needed, focusing on a greater use of fiscal and pro-growth structural policies, to strengthen growth and reduce financial risks.”the oecd projects that the global economy will grow by 3 percent this year and 3.3 percent in 2017, which is well below long-run averages of around 3¾ percent. this is also lower than would be expected during a recovery phase for advanced economies, and given the pace of growth that could be achieved by emerging economies in convergence mode.the us will grow by 2 percent this year and by 2.2 percent in 2017, while the uk is projected to grow at 2.1 percent in 2016 and 2 percent in 2017. canadian growth is projected at 1.4 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2017, while japan is projected to grow by 0.8 percent in 2016 and 0.6 percent in 2017. the euro area is projected to grow at a 1.4 percent rate in 2016 and a 1.7 percent pace in 2017. germany is forecast to grow by 1.3 percent in 2016 and 1.7 percent in 2017, france by 1.2 percent in 2016 and 1.5 percent in 2017, while italy will see a 1 percent rate in 2016 and 1.4 percent rate in 2017. with china expected to continue rebalancing its economy from manufacturing to services, growth is forecast at 6.5 percent in 2016 and 6.2 percent in 2017. india will continue to grow robustly, by 7.4 percent in 2016 and 7.3 percent in 2017. by contrast, brazil’s economy is experiencing a deep recession and is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year and only to begin to emerge from the downturn next year.the interim economic outlook calls for a stronger policy response, changing the policy mix to confront the current weak growth more effectively. it points out that sole reliance on monetary policy has proven insufficient to boost demand and produce satisfactory growth, while fiscal policy is contractionary in several major economies and structural reform momentum has slowed.the oecd says monetary policies should remain highly accommodative in advanced economies, until inflation has shown clear signs of moving durably towards official targets. in emerging market economies, monetary support should be provided where possible, taking into account inflation developments and capital market responses.the outlook suggests that a stronger fiscal policy response, combined with renewed structural reforms, is needed to support growth and provide a more favourable environment for productivity-enhancing innovation and change, particularly in europe.“with governments in many countries currently able to borrow for long periods at very low interest rates, there is room for fiscal expansion to strengthen demand in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability,” ms mann said. “the focus should be on policies with strong short-run benefits and that also contribute to long-term growth. a commitment to raising public investment would boost demand and help support future growth,” ms mann said.media queries should be directed to the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700, news.contact@oecd.org)."

has made impressive economic, social and environmental progress, but further institutional and policy reforms will be necessary to ensure stronger and more inclusive growth, according to the first-ever oecd economic assessment of costa rica.the assessment, presented in san josé today by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and costa rican president luis guillermo solís, underlines the country’s success in attracting foreign direct investment, boosting living standards and improving well-being over the past 30 years, but also points out serious challenges that have emerged, particularly as concerns public finances. “the costa rican economy is gradually recovering from the global economic crisis, and is now expected to grow faster than most of the other countries in latin america, as well as most of those in the oecd,” mr gurría said. “while growth is projected to remain strong over the coming two years, at about 4% annually, budgetary pressures are becoming more persistent. putting the house in order will require raising more tax revenues, restraining public spending while improving its efficiency and ensuring that public finances are managed in an effective manner.” (read the speech in spanish)the oecd economic assessment of costa rica feeds into the country’s ongoing oecd accession process, which was launched in april 2015. it aims to contribute to the design and implementation of reforms that will help costa rica continue modernising while improving living standards for all.the assessment suggests that costa rica take immediate steps toward the consolidation of public finances, through programmed cuts to the government deficit over the coming three years. swift implementation of the proposed tax reform, combatting tax evasion, eliminating tax exemptions and curbing growth in public spending will be critical. introduction of a medium-term fiscal framework, with a clear and verifiable expenditure rule, is also recommended.to ensure continuing advances in income and living standards, the assessment calls for new reforms to boost productivity growth. the main priority is to improve competition policy and governance of state-owned enterprises. productivity would also be enhanced by promoting innovation, better access to finance and transport infrastructure.reforms for bringing about a stronger economy go hand-in-hand with efforts to make costa rica a more inclusive society, notably for informal workers and women, according to the assessment. improving the quality of education and enhancing the effectiveness of cash transfers in reducing poverty would expand opportunities and share prosperity more widely.the report was presented in san josé in the context of the official visit that the oecd secretary-general is making to advance costa rica’s accession process to the organisation, including meetings with president solís and several ministers, as well as members of the parliament, the business community, trade unions and civil society.an overview of the economic assessment, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at:

country’s ongoing oecd accession process, which was launched in april 2015, on the basis of a decision by the oecd council to open accession discussions with both costa rica and lithuania.costa rica is now working through an accession roadmap, which sets out the terms, conditions and process for its accession to the organization. the accession roadmap calls for a series of in-depth reviews conducted by 23 oecd technical committees, which, in turn, will provide a formal opinion to the oecd council on costa rica’s willingness and ability to implement oecd standards, and of its policies and practices as compared to oecd best policies and practices in the relevant area.these reviews are seen as an opportunity to support the costa rican authorities in pushing forward reforms consistent with oecd standards and best practices. there is no set timeline or end date for the accession process, and progress made ultimately depends on costa rica’s response to recommendations made by oecd committees, formed by its 34 member countries.the oecd promotes policies that improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. the organisation provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems.the oecd's members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany,

562@Israel’s economy is sound but it urgently needs to address productivity, inequality and poverty@http://www.oecd.org/economy/israels-economy-is-sound-but-it-urgently-needs-to-address-productivity-inequality-and-poverty.htm@31/1/16 – israel’s economy has strong fundamentals, but the country needs to address productivity, inequality and poverty if it wants to improve well-being and reduce socio-economic divides, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of israel.the release coincided with the fifth anniversary of israel’s accession to the oecd. the survey was presented by oecd secretary-general, angel gurría, to prime minister benjamin netanyahu during a cabinet meeting today. the survey says that improving productivity and raising living standards will require strengthening competition and efficiency in the domestic economy. the oecd report also highlights that boosting investment in infrastructure and promoting skills, particularly among disadvantaged groups can both enhance social cohesion and raise long-term growth.the oecd is also today releasing a study entitled measuring and assessing well-being in israel. this report will complement an israeli government-led initiative to publish information that helps improve measurement of “what matters most to people.” the report shows that, while israel performs well and is among the best in the oecd in terms of life satisfaction, health status and educational attainment, it has poor outcomes compared to oecd averages in areas such as poverty, housing and air quality. additionally, israel has a high level of inequality, with the israeli arab and haredi populations experiencing higher than average rates of poverty, and lower levels of labour force participation and educational attainment than is the case for secular jews. this contributes to overall levels of human capital in israel which are significantly below the oecd average. “these two reports together provide israel with a snapshot of the state of its economy and societal well-being’” said mr. gurría. “growth rates have exceeded those in most other oecd countries for more than a decade; employment is rising; inflation is low; and the public finances are in relatively good shape; but, there is homework to do if everyone in israeli society is to benefit from this strong growth.” (read the speech)the economic survey urges israel to maintain its current expansionary monetary policy stance and implement further protective measures if risks to the financial system rise, especially from the dynamic housing sector. israel should also reduce its structural budget deficit, remove inefficient tax expenditures and raise environmental taxes – including by establishing a carbon tax.in terms of product market reform, israel should ensure that the planned reduction of the regulatory burden relies on high-quality regulatory impact assessments and should cut tariffs and non-tariff barriers further, in particular by adopting internationally standardised procedures related to phyto-sanitary regulations on food and agricultural goods. relatively high price levels due to weak competition, in particular in the food sector, impose an especially heavy cost, in terms of living standards, on socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.the oecd survey notes that the israeli banking sector is concentrated and inefficient. israel should follow through on plans to allow the entry of new competitors in retail banking, in particular by non-banking credit entities, with appropriate consumer protection and financial risk regulation.to address the weaknesses of an electricity market still dominated by a heavily indebted, publicly owned, vertically integrated company, the oecd suggests turning the israel electricity corporation into a holding company and creating a separate infrastructure operator. it also suggests creating independent regulators with well-defined mandates in the telecoms, postal services and gas sectors.poverty is especially high among the elderly in israel, in part because of low basic pensions. employment rates for haredi men and arab-israeli women, while improving, remain low. rising house prices impose an additional affordability burden, increasingly even on the middle class. the oecd recommends streamlining the administrative requirements for planning and building a home, further developing public transport infrastructure to make it easier to live in lower-priced housing areas and promoting labour market participation for those living in remote areas. to reduce elderly poverty, israel should increase the generosity of basic pensions without creating work disincentives. additional steps could include increasing education funding for disadvantaged groups, ensuring haredi schools teach mathematics, science and foreign languages and expanding the earned income tax credit and active labour market policies.an overview of the economic survey of israel and the measuring and assessing well-being in israel report are available at http://www.oecd.org/israel/economic-survey-israel.htm.further information on the visit to israel can be found here: http://www.oecd.org/israel/oecd-secretary-general-in-israel-on-31-january-and-1-february-2016.htm

564@How can South Africa’s tax system meet revenue raising challenges?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrp1g0xztbr-en@reforms over the past two decades have produced a well-balanced, modern tax system. however, considerable revenues will be needed in the years ahead to expand social spending and infrastructure in order to raise growth and well-being. the challenge is to generate these revenues without penalising growth or exacerbating inequality. income taxes represent around half of total tax revenue but are levied on small tax bases, partly reflecting the distribution of income. a revenue source less detrimental to growth is consumption taxes, which are mostly raised by the relatively broad value-added tax. nonetheless, there is some scope to raise further revenue, particularly through broadening the base of these taxes further. revenues from property taxation are currently limited by the inefficient municipal rates system, which does not function well. an important additional source of revenue is environmentally related taxes. in the design of the tax system, consideration should also be given to the appropriate taxation of the natural resources sector, which remains an important issue for a resource-rich country like south africa.
565@Adjusting fiscal balances for the business cycle: new tax and expenditure elasticity estimates for OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrp1g3282d7-en@this paper re-estimates the elasticities of government revenue and expenditure items with respect to the output gap for oecd countries. these elasticities are used by the oecd to calculate cyclically adjusted fiscal balances. the study updates the earlier 2005 study using the most recent datasets and tax codes, the coverage being confined in this paper to 35 countries, the 34 oecd member states and latvia. the same two-step methodology is retained: revenue and expenditure elasticities with respect to the output gap being defined as the product of, first, the elasticities of individual revenue and expenditure items with respect to their bases and, second, the elasticities of these bases with respect to the output gap. a number of refinements and methodological improvements are made relative to the 2005 study. the revisions to individual elasticities relative to the 2005 vintage are significant in a number of cases but do not follow a clear pattern across countries, except for the elasticities of corporate income tax revenue which are revised up in most cases.
566@Who are the top 1% earners in Europe?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrp1g39gkzw-en@top earners have become the subject of intense public and scholarly debate. this is the first paper that comprehensively documents the profiles of the 1% highest paid employees across 18 european countries. the data come from the largest harmonised source available, an employer-based survey that covers the labour income of 10 million employees, excluding the self-employed. the patterns that emerge are broadly common across countries. workers in the top 1% tend to be 40 to 60 years old, be men, have tertiary education, work in finance or manufacturing, and be senior managers. the analysis also uncovers several cross-country differences. for example, top earners are younger in eastern europe, and they include more women in countries with higher overall female employment. the new estimates in this paper are similar to related ones based on administrative records in the few countries for which such studies exist, indicating that the sample is broadly representative of the characteristics of top earners.
567@The time is now for a new Latin America-China partnership to foster mutual development strategies, says the Latin American Economic Outlook 2016@http://www.oecd.org/economy/press-release-latam-econ-outlook-2016.htm@"cartagena, colombia - 11 december 2015 - latin america’s gdp growth slowdown deepened and is expected to be negative in 2015. for a second consecutive year, latin america falls behind the average growth of oecd countries after a full decade of convergence with advanced economies, according to the latin american economic outlook 2016.weaker global growth, lower commodity prices and a loss of investment momentum are having an impact on the region’s growth. however, latin american and caribbean economies are not homogeneous: manufacture exporters in mexico and central america are recovering, whereas andean countries struggle to maintain growth and two key economies –brazil and venezuela – are now in recession.in their annual jointly produced report, the oecd development centre, the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean (eclac) and caf – development bank of latin america call for an enhanced latin america-china partnership. as the china-led shifting wealth phenomenon - where the global economy’s centre of gravity is shifting more towards emerging economies - enters a new phase, affecting the global economy, latin america should try to face the challenges of addressing its inclusive growth agenda, say the outlook’s authors.“the middle-income trap is a persistent challenge for latin america, which needs to pursue a greater degree of productive diversification, upgrading and integration. china’s new normal is a wake-up call and an opportunity for the region’s development strategy towards these goals,” oecd development centre director, mario pezzini, said while launching the outlook at the first meeting of foreign affairs ministers of the ibero-american conference in cartagena de indias on december 11th.since 2000, the trade relationship between latin america and china has experienced an exceptional expansion, multiplying 22 fold, compared to a 3 fold increase with the world at large, says the report. the evolution of china’s participation in latin american global value chains has been remarkable and has even surpassed intraregional ones: between 2000 and 2011, the region’s intraregional share of backward linkages grew from 5% to 9%, and china’s share roared from 1% to 11%. today, china is the largest trading partner for brazil, chile and peru. latin america has to advance in its integration agenda, building on existing platforms such as mercosur, the pacific alliance and caricom to grasp the benefits of higher integration in global value chains. ms. alicia bárcena, eclac’s executive secretary, called for “better integrated regional markets, since they offer opportunities to serve larger consumer demand, achieve economies of scale and attract greater foreign direct investment, combined with measures enhancing competition and better access to global value chains.”integration is all the more key as lower chinese demand for commodities, together with a fall in prices, is set to continue affecting latin american commodity exporters over the next decades. according to the outlook’s projections, latin america’s export growth will slow from 16% to 4% by 2030 in the case of metals and energy, and from 12% to 3% for food.to seize the momentum of the new opportunities propelled by china’s new normal and to remain competitive, latin american and caribbean economies need, first, to pursue innovative development policies to better cater to growing chinese domestic demand, notably in the agro-food industry and services. designing policies and a truly effective strategy in skills and innovation will also be essential to keep up with how china is strengthening its human capital. by 2030, nearly 200 million chinese will have attained tertiary education, doubling the number of latin america’s graduates.“latin america and china must work together in the deepening of a dynamic, long-term and strategic relationship based on a common agenda. such a relationship should promote symmetry in trading relations, technology transfers and strategic investments,” said enrique garcía, ceo and president of caf – development bank of latin america.existing financial ties between the region and china need to be deepened and optimised. chinese loans to latin america have reached usd 94 billion since 2010, with china becoming the region’s largest lender. this trend is likely to persist, expanding to new countries and sectors. however, according to the outlook, lending should be matched by greater transparency and regulation, particularly vis-à-vis environmental impacts.shifting towards skill- and technology-intensive industries and optimising financing flows to close the infrastructure gap could help maximise benefits offered by china’s new normal. in this way, china can maintain latin america as a reliable source of commodities, a sound market for its exports and an attractive destination for diversifying its outward investment.for more information on the latin american economic outlook 2016: towards a new partnership with china, visit: www.latameconomy.org.to obtain a copy

568@Towards more gender equality in Austria@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrp2s4pfbnp-en@there is ample empirical evidence for strong and persistent patterns of separated gender roles in austria. while this model is generally considered to have worked well in the past, it faces important challenges arising from societal and economic changes in austria. hence, gender mainstreaming with the aim of more gender equality ranks high on the agenda of austrian policy makers. an integrated policy framework to make austria more gender-equal should build on 3 pillars: i) make the tax and benefit system more employment friendly ii) extend the care service infrastructure and iii) encourage more flexible workplace practices. streamlining family policies across regions and levels of government would entail efficiency gains for all pillars. long-run simulations suggest that achieving more gender equality in austria could boost gdp by 13 percentage points until 2060. in addition, promoting more gender equality in the austrian society will improve austrians’ well-being.

570@Are the SDGs a major reboot or a sequel to the MDGs?@http://www.oecd.org/economy/development-posts-sdg-reboot-or-sequel-mdg.htm@‌‌by: jan vandemoortele, phd, co-architect of the mdgs and a critical friend of the sdgsthe main reason for putting together the millennium development goals (mdgs) was to prevent the millennium declaration from falling into oblivion. a declaration issued by a world summit has a shelf-life of about six months. beyond that period, its life is reduced to a small world, usually the summit’s sponsoring agency. a few months after the millennium summit, once the declaration started to fade away, a group of experts from across the united nations convened to go through the millennium declaration. experts from the organisation of economic co-operation and development also took part. eighteen targets were selected and placed verbatim in a stand-alone list. they were grouped under eight goals, and 48 indicators were added for global monitoring. that list of goals, targets and indicators was submitted to the un general assembly in late 2001 under the heading millennium development goals. and the rest is history.the selection took extensive discussions and negotiations, but it was never the intention to represent a global agenda for development. we simply saw the mdgs as a way to maintain the millennium declaration’s relevance. two criteria, though not strictly applied, played a role in the selection: clarity and measurability.the purpose of the sustainable development goals (sdgs), however, is totally different. from the beginning, stakeholders aimed for a global agenda for development. in this sense, the sdgs are not the sequel to the mdgs; they represent a major reboot. since the sdgs are more comprehensive than the mdgs, and resulted from an extensive and participatory process, it is normal that considerably more targets (169 versus 18) and more words (about 5,000 versus about 300) are needed to spell out the sdgs than the mdgs.yet, a closer examination shows that, despite their comprehensiveness and wordy nature, the sdgs lack sufficient specifics to qualify as a major reboot. to be valid, a target must contain three elements: (i) a numerical outcome, (ii) a specific deadline and (iii) a well defined domain.item 3.1, for example, is a valid target: by 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.on the other hand, item 17.2 does not contain a deadline: developed countries to implement fully their oda commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 percent of oda/gni.item 16.5 — substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms — lacks all three elements.the sdgs actually contain many such items as 16.5. the list is a mixture of ideals and norms, values and principles, generalities and oddities, and some repetitions; a few valid targets are sprinkled in. indeed, the sdgs may contain 169 bullets, but actually fewer than 30 are concrete targets. not only does their complexity turn the sdgs into a difficult storyline, but also their fuzziness will create leeway and latitude for non-objective narratives.the concrete targets are not dissimilar from the mdgs, since they mostly cover issues such as poverty and hunger, child and maternal mortality, safe water, education and gender equality. in short, the sdgs are not quite a reboot or a paradigm shift. neither do they represent a universal agenda that addresses inequality and sustainability. plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose!such a critical assessment often provokes an angry response. but a healthy dose of objectivity is warranted. otherwise, we risk falling victim to the tyranny of an acronym, suspending critical thinking because it could endanger the agreement about the sdgs.our criticism does not imply that the sdgs have no worth. but their practical implementation requires that we move beyond appearances. implementation needs to start with each country selecting and adapting those aspects of the sdgs that are most relevant to their national context. this is often dismissed as opening the floodgates to cherry-picking, which is only valid if the selection and adaptation were done through a non-participatory process. besides government, such selection and adaptation need to include civil society, academics, think tanks, trade unions and employers federations, and other important groupings.at the global level, implementation of the sdgs requires addressing three aspects.first, the way of aggregating the global narrative needs to change radically. this was mostly driven by global statistics and world maps for the mdgs, with off-track countries coloured in red. this time around, the global assessment needs to pay more attention to how global targets make a difference at national and sub-national levels.second, the choice of indicators must help remedy some of the flaws in the formulation of the sdgs. the inclusion of the palma ratio, for instance, can fix target 10.1 about inequality. the inclusion of body mass indices can fix target 2.2, which ignores the growing challenge of being overweight or obese.third and last, one of the few truly universal targets in the sdgs cannot be left orphaned. it concerns bullet 1.2 – by 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. the global narrative is already focusing on extreme poverty and hunger, which are not universal targets. who will be championing target 1.2? who will compile the register of national definitions to help clarify the domain?by addressing these aspects, the considerable time and efforts invested in the sdg negotiations by countless stakeholders will not have been an exercise in futility.
571@Searching for the inclusive growth tax grail: the distributional impact of growth enhancing tax reform in Ireland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrqc6vk3n30-en@the economic literature suggests that a revenue-neutral shift of tax revenues from income taxes to property taxes would increase gdp per capita in the medium term. this paper analyses for ireland the consequences of such a shift in the tax mix. in particular, it examines whether this can be carried out in a way that would neither undermine income distribution nor depress government revenue. simulations using the esri tax-benefit model, switch, suggest it is possible to achieve such a broadly revenue-neutral tax shift in a non-regressive way, while lowering marginal tax rates for most taxpayers. in particular, reductions in the universal social charge would reduce marginal and average tax rates and have a positive impact for the income of most households. this could be funded by shifting the tax base toward residential properties, though this might have an adverse effect on income distribution, due to ireland’s high rates of home ownership throughout the income distribution. the analysis shows that low income groups could be protected through the careful introduction of income-related supports, with revenue losses recovered through a more progressive property tax rate structure. overall, the simulations show that a shift from labour to property tax can be pro-growth and pro-employment, without equity losses. the paper therefore suggests that tax reform can be inclusive.
572@Taxes, income and economic mobility in Ireland: new evidence from tax records data@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrqc6zlgq31-en@this paper analyses income inequality in ireland using a new panel dataset based on the administrative tax records of the revenue commissioners for ireland. high inequality at market incomes in ireland by international standards appears to be driven by both ends of the income distribution. an analysis of income mobility over time shows it has been low at both ends of the income distribution, though it increased at the low end once the crisis began, reflecting the sharp deterioration of the labour market. the data confirms that the tax system is highly progressive at the high end of income distribution and the welfare system provides the most significant support to lower income deciles in ireland. the redistributive function in the tax and benefit system was enhanced during the last decade, not only because more income support was necessitated with the crisis, but also because of steeper and more progressive tax rates. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of ireland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-ireland.

578@Emerging market slowdown and drop in trade clouding global outlook@http://www.oecd.org/economy/emerging-market-slowdown-and-drop-in-trade-clouding-global-outlook.htm@9/11/2015-a further sharp downturn in emerging market economies and world trade has weakened global growth to around 2.9% this year – well below the long-run average – and is a source of uncertainty for near-term prospects, says the oecd. in its latest twice-yearly economic outlook, the oecd projects a gradual strengthening of global growth in 2016 and 2017 to an annual 3.3% and 3.6% respectively. but a clear pick-up in activity requires a smooth rebalancing of activity in china and more robust investment in advanced economies.emerging market challenges, weak trade and concerns about potential output suggest higher downside risks and vulnerabilities compared with the oecd’s june outlook.presenting the outlook in paris, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “the slowdown in global trade and the continuing weakness in investment are deeply concerning. robust trade and investment and stronger global growth should go hand in hand. g-20 leaders meeting in antalya need to renew their efforts to secure strong, sustainable and balanced growth.” (read the speech)in the us, output remains on a solid growth trajectory, propelled by household demand, with gdp expansion expected to be 2.5% next year and 2.4% in 2017. the recovery in the euro area is set to strengthen, helped by accommodative monetary policy, lower oil prices and an easing of the pace of budget tightening. euro area activity is expected to grow by 1.8% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. in japan, recovery was derailed in 2015 by a sharp slowdown in demand from other asian economies and sluggish consumption. japan’s gdp growth is expected to accelerate to 1.0% next year, but to slow to 0.5% in 2017 due to the planned consumption tax hike. economic growth in china is projected to slow to 6.8% in 2015 and to continue to decline gradually thereafter, reaching 6.2% by 2017, as activity rebalances towards consumption and services. achieving this rebalancing, whilst avoiding a sharp reduction in gdp growth and containing financial stability risks, presents significant challenges.in other emerging economies, headwinds have generally increased, reflecting weaker commodity prices, tighter credit conditions and lower potential output growth, with the risk that capital outflows and sharp currency depreciations may expose financial vulnerabilities. brazil and russia have experienced recessions and will not return to positive growth in annual terms until 2017. by contrast, growth prospects in india remain relatively robust, with gdp growth expected to remain over 7% in the coming years, provided further progress is made in implementing structural reforms.the outlook calls for greater ambition by oecd and g20 countries in supporting demand and pursuing structural reforms to boost potential growth and ensure that its economic benefits are shared by all.it calls for policies to support short-term demand, including on-going monetary and fiscal policy support in accordance with countries’ policy space. collective action to increase public investment is essential and would increase growth without increasing debt-to-gdp ratios.in the run up to the cop21 un climate change conference in paris, a special chapter of the economic outlook calls for unequivocal action to address climate change, which is critical for long-term economic sustainability and healthy growth.most climate policies could be budget-neutral and support growth. there are plenty of examples of countries that have taken action successfully without negative consequences. an effective policy stance would create a more positive environment for investment that would support growth and trade, as well as put us on a path to urgently-needed climate improvement.the economic outlook also looks at the labour market and fiscal impact of the european refugee surge, and will release on thursday, in advance of the g20 summit in antalya, a policy note on this issue.in addition, the outlook includes a scenario for the global impact of weaker demand growth in china and discusses a number of other issues including: rising us policy interest rates and spill-overs to emerging market economies; growth shortfalls in the euro area and japan; revisions to potential output growth; and the impact of an increase in public investment in oecd economies.the oecd latest monthly composite leading indicator (cli) is also released today.further information about the economic outlook is available at http://www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm or from the oecd’s media division (tel: +33 1 45 24 97 00). an online read-only version is also available.
579@Brazil faces critical moment to put economy back on track@http://www.oecd.org/economy/brazil-faces-critical-moment-to-put-economy-back-on-track.htm@4/11/15-brazil has made remarkable social and economic progress in the past two decades, but must now overcome important challenges if it is to put its economy on a stronger, fairer, greener growth trajectory, according to two new reports from the oecd.oecd secretary-general ángel gurría presented the economic survey of brazil and the environmental performance review of brazil in brasilia during meetings with brazil’s finance minister joaquim levy and environment minister izabella teixeira. this follows the launch on 3 november of the new oecd-brazil programme of work, which seeks to further strengthen cooperation in various policy areas.the economic survey says that brazil is at a critical moment, as the fiscal situation is challenging, inflation is high and previous tailwinds from high commodity prices are fading. all of this is putting pressure on the wider economy, which is projected to contract by 3.1% this year and a further 1.2% in 2016. the survey recommends brazil move ahead with the planned fiscal adjustment, which will be critical for strengthening public finances, restoring market confidence and preparing for intense population ageing. brazil will also need to rein in the expansion of public expenditures, notably by making public spending more effective and reforming the pension system. improved targeting of social benefits - spending more on the poor, and less on benefits for those who have successfully joined the middle class - could simultaneously reduce inequality while strengthening the public finances.“macroeconomic stability has been a crucial factor behind brazil’s success in the past,” mr gurría said, but he warned: “progress must continue on the fiscal and monetary fronts. ambitious structural reforms are urgently needed to close the productivity gaps with other leading emerging economies while ensuring all brazilians can share the fruits of prosperity.” (read the speech in full)raising productivity will be essential for brazil’s future economic growth, particularly in the industrial sector, which still has significant unexploited potential. reforms to the fragmented indirect tax system, better infrastructure, increased competition and stronger integration into international trade are essential both to raise productivity and improve the incentives to innovate. ambitious structural reform to reduce the so-called ‘brazil cost’ is urgently needed to unleash the full potential of the economy.one chapter of the survey commends progress in health care, but points out that inequalities in access and waiting times for some medical services remain. to further reduce these bottlenecks, brazil will need to expand capacity, train more doctors and nurses and improve the efficiency of health spending. the current governance structure of the health system is complex, and more could be done to collect performance indicators, evaluate progress and improve coordination mechanisms.the oecd’s first-ever environmental performance review of brazil draws attention to the strong progress made in reducing deforestation and emissions of greenhouse gases over the past 15 years. it also points out, however, that a decade of rapid urbanisation and economic growth have increased pressure on the environment, with severe water shortages in the southeast, soil contamination from inadequate wastewater treatment and rising air pollution. more people now have access to clean water, sanitation and waste management services, but regional disparities are large. “brazil has made tremendous progress in terms of its environmental performance, but rigorous policy implementation remains critically important,” mr gurría said. “greening the economy can also bring huge social and economic opportunities, with green markets offering potential to boost gdp by up to 7 percent.” (read the speech in full)the high share of hydropower and biofuels in the brazilian energy mix helps keep the economy’s carbon intensity low; to that end, greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by more than 40% since 2000, thanks to the decline in deforestation, but emissions from industry and transport are nonetheless rising.the review recommends brazil do more to link environmental priorities with economic policies so as to ensure the sustainable use of its environmental resources. brazil should strengthen implementation and enforcement capacity at local level to reduce the gap between ambitious environmental goals and policies actually implemented in areas such as public transport and waste management.the review also recommended that brazil:• adjust energy taxes to reflect the carbon content of fuels and introduce taxes on pollution, waste and use of natural resources.• explore opportunities for eco-tourism in its vast protected area network.• develop a framework law for payments for ecosystem services and better monitor their effectiveness.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: www.oecd.org/brazil/economic-survey-brazil.htm.an overview of the environmental performance review, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: www.oecd.org/brazil/oecd-environmental-performance-reviews-brazil-2015-9789264240094-en.htmyou are invited to include these internet links in media reports. for further information, contact lawrence speer (+33 6 0149 6891) or the oecd media office (+33 1 45 24 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
580@Betting the house in Denmark@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jln042vd3kk-en@the danish financial sector is big and there is a high degree of inter-connectedness between banks, mortgage institutions and pension funds. danish households have large balance sheets and high levels of gross debt. even though the high debt levels are matched by large assets, notably in form of pension savings, there are feedback loops with the housing market and households’ balance sheets contributing to macroeconomic volatility. currently, the very low interest rate environment may contribute to the building up of risks, notably in the housing market. given the on-going recovery of the housing market, it is an opportune time to eliminate the debt-bias in taxation, which would strengthen the automatic stabilisers of the fiscal system. in addition, further liberalising the private rental market would help create a more dynamic housing market overall and reduce the need to meet housing needs primarily with the owner occupancy segment.

shows the extent to which some children are getting a better start in life than others. income poverty affects one child in seven in oecd countries, while 10% of children live in jobless households. since the economic crisis, child poverty rates have risen in two thirds of oecd countries. in most oecd countries, the poverty rate for children is higher than for the population in general.click here to see more countries and download the data in excel looking at child well-being for the first time, the report shows how children from more affluent backgrounds tend to have better health and a happier school life. children from less well-off families find fewer of their classmates to be kind and helpful and are more likely to be bullied at school. life satisfaction, reading and problem-solving skills, communication with parents and intentions to vote in national elections in later life are all lower among children from less affluent backgrounds. growing inequality among parents ends up sapping opportunities available to their children. presenting the report at the 5th oecd world forum on statistics, knowledge and policy in guadalajara, mexico, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said, “policies will fail to build a better society if they do not take into account the needs of all of its members – particularly the very young. the fight against inequality begins by ensuring that everyone enjoys opportunities to thrive in life, especially from an early age.” (read the full speech in english or spanish)the report also provides the latest evidence on well-being among the wider population, including changes in well-being over time, inequalities in well-being outcomes among different groups, and critical resources that will shape well-being in the future.how’s life? highlights the importance of volunteering, finding that it makes a significant contribution to well-being – both for society at large and for volunteers themselves. unpaid, socially useful work for the community produces goods and services that are not captured by conventional economic statistics, and whose value amounts to around 2% of gdp on average in the oecd.“the oecd’s work on well-being is providing essential insights into whether we are succeeding in delivering better and more inclusive growth. this report broadens our understanding of progress by focusing on people and the quality of their lives, not just on whether gdp is going up.” said mr. gurría.how’s life? finds that where you live, how old you are, and whether you are a man or a woman are also among the factors that affect your well-being. the data show:• gaps in well-being between regions in a country can be as large as differences between oecd countries. for example, regional employment rates in italy range from 40% in campania to 73% in bolzano, which is similar to the difference between greece (49%) and iceland (82%).• intergenerational inequalities can be stark. the steep increase in long-term unemployment that has occurred since 2009 has disproportionately affected young people. however, people under 30 are more likely than those aged over 50 to feel they have friends or relatives they can count on in troubled times.• men and women face different types of risks to their personal safety. in the majority of oecd countries, men have a higher risk of death due to assault than women. however, women often feel much less safe than men when walking alone at night in the area where they live.• indicators of work-life balance show that 1 in 8 employees in the oecd work very long hours (50 or more per week). full-time workers in france, spain, denmark, belgium, norway and germany enjoy at least an hour a day of leisure more than those living in the us, poland, canada and australia.• where you live also affects the quality of the air you breathe. an estimated 42 million people across the oecd area are exposed to pm air pollution levels well in excess of both who and eu air quality guidelines.the how’s life? report is part of the oecd better life initiative launched in 2011 to measure well-being and progress beyond traditional metrics such as gdp. another component of the initiative, the better life index, allows users to compare countries according to their own vision of what constitutes well-being.individual country highlights and further information of how’s life?

action@http://www.oecd.org/economy/sub-par-global-growth-and-slowdown-in-emerging-economies-requires-a-shift-in-policy-action.htm@"16/09/2015-economic recovery is progressing in the world’s advanced economies, but stagnating world trade and deteriorating conditions in financial markets are curbing growth prospects in many of the major emerging economies, according to the oecd’s latest interim economic outlook.rising employment and household consumption are driving solid growth in the united states, but investment continues to disappoint. growth in the euro area is improving, but not as fast as would be expected given the falls that have been seen in oil prices, long-term interest rates and the value of the euro. in japan, growth is on an improving path, but tightening labour markets have yet to feed into the wage increases that would underpin sustained consumption growth and facilitate the achievement of the bank of japan’s inflation objective. a key puzzle in the short-term outlook centres on china, where recorded growth has held up well, but some indicators point to a slower underlying pace of economic activity. the marked slowdown in chinese import demand has important spillover effects on global growth, particularly in emerging economies with close trade links to china, and those that depend on commodities. india is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy over the coming two years, while the outlook is weaker for many commodity-exporting nations, with brazil experiencing a deep recession.the impact of a larger-than-expected slowdown in chinese demand through direct trade and investment links would be significant, especially for those countries most heavily exposed, but would not derail the global recovery unless combined with a large and widespread correction in global financial markets.“global growth prospects have weakened slightly and the outlook is clouded by important uncertainties,” said oecd chief economist catherine l. mann. “emerging economies have vulnerabilities that could be exposed by rising us interest rates and/or a sharper-than-expected slowdown in china, giving rise to financial and economic turbulence that could also exert a significant drag on advanced economies. continued policy stimulus is warranted to support global demand, but the mix of policies will differ by country, and choices need to be consistent with financial stability and reviving long-run growth.”the oecd projects that the us will grow by 2.4 percent this year and by 2.6 percent in 2016, while the uk is projected to grow at 2.4 percent in 2015 and 2.3 per cent in 2016. canadian growth is projected at 1.1 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2016, while japan is projected to grow by 0.6 percent in 2015 and 1.2 percent in 2016. the euro area is projected to grow at a 1.6 percent rate in 2015 and a 1.9 percent pace in 2016. growth prospects differ widely among the major euro area economies. germany is forecast to grow by 1.6 percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016, france by 1 percent in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2016, while italy will see a 0.7 percent rate in 2015 and 1.3 percent in 2016. china is expected to grow by 6.7 percent in 2015 and 6.5 percent in 2016. india will grow by 7.2 percent in 2015 and 7.3 percent in 2016. brazil’s economy is expected to shrink by 2.8 percent in 2015 and then by an additional 0.7 percent rate in 2016.the interim economic outlook calls for global macroeconomic policy to remain supportive of demand. advanced economies should continue accommodative monetary and fiscal policies to ensure that the recovery gains momentum. the us federal reserve will soon need to begin to raise its policy rate at a gradual pace, given the solid growth of the us economy and concerns over asset prices. the timing of the first rate rise will make little difference to the outcome, but the pace of increase does matter.“the pace of recovery in the euro area is disappointing, given the favourable factors from which they are benefitting. this calls for the continuation of accommodative monetary and more growth-oriented fiscal policies, which must work together to add momentum to the expansion and create spillover effects into labour markets, business investment and trade,” ms mann said.ensuring balanced and sustainable growth in china, as well as addressing vulnerabilities in the financial system will be a major challenge. authorities should use the room they have to provide further policy stimulus to avoid a sharp slowdown, but must ensure that that stimulus fosters sustainable growth. a range of policies would help, including services liberalisation and expanding social expenditures to support consumption growth. other economies also need to strike a balance between supporting demand and allowing adjustment to take place, while being mindful of financial vulnerabilities, according to the interim economic outlook.“with an eye toward towards the medium term, ambitious structural policies are needed in advanced and emerging countries alike, to encourage investment and reverse the slowdown in the growth potential output, which represents the wherewithal to make good on promises to the young, the old, and investors alike,” ms mann said.media queries should be directed to the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700, news.contact@oecd.org)."
584@Ireland needs to sustain reform momentum to secure economic recovery and ensure it benefits all@http://www.oecd.org/economy/ireland-needs-to-sustain-reform-momentum-to-secure-economic-recovery-and-ensure-it-benefits-all.htm@15/09/15-a strong commitment to reform and a business-friendly environment have helped ireland return to robust economic expansion, offering the government an opportunity to heal the scars of the crisis, according to the latest oecd economic survey of ireland.the survey, presented in dublin today by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and ireland’s finance minister michael noonan, says the irish economy is on a sounder footing than before the crisis. unemployment is falling, the fiscal deficit continues to narrow, public debt is on a downward path, the banking sector has been restructured and recapitalised and the public administration has become more efficient. after posting an oecd-leading growth rate of 5.2% in 2014, the survey projects irish gdp will grow by 5% in 2015 and 4% in 2016.“ireland is the ‘comeback kid’ of europe’s crisis-hit economies, and much of the credit for this strong recovery goes to the government’s steadfast commitment to reform,” mr gurría said. “to avoid repeating past mistakes, now is the time to build resilience against future nasty surprises while ensuring the recovery is sustained, and its benefits broadly shared.” (read the speech in full) to make growth more inclusive, ireland’s top priority should be further reducing the still-high levels of post-crisis unemployment, particularly for youth and the long-term unemployed. to boost skills, the government should continue with plans to improve the apprenticeship system and other forms of training. remaining unemployment traps should be eased, for instance by slowing the withdrawal of housing and family income supplements as income increases. relative to the average wage, ireland has the highest child care costs in the oecd, so improving affordability is essential, particularly for low-income families.additional efforts are also needed to further strengthen the banking system, the oecd said. while the stock of non-performing loans is falling, the number is still high, and their resolution is being held up by a slow legal system. the property market needs to be carefully monitored, and further regulatory measures taken if credit growth starts to drive up prices.the survey encourages ireland to take advantage of the strong economic recovery to accelerate the reduction of the government’s deficit and put public debt, which stands at 108% of gdp, on a more steeply declining trend.the survey also suggests ireland enact further reforms to increase productivity, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), which is the key to raising living standards over the long-term. to achieve this goal, public support for innovation should be rebalanced in favour of direct supports, which are more relevant to smaller firms than the tax incentives that currently predominate. intensifying competition in legal services, ports and utilities would benefit all firms, as would improvements to infrastructure and public transport. smes should also receive better support to access the global talent pool.an embeddable version of the economic survey is available together with information about downloadable and print versions of the report.overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: http://oecd.org/ireland/economic-survey-ireland.htm.you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey. for further information on the economic survey, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
585@Gender equality and economic growth in India: a quantitative framework@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrtpbnt7zf4-en@this paper studies how public policies, including pro-women interventions, can raise female labour force participation and promote economic growth in india. the first part provides a brief review of gender issues in the country. the second part presents a gender-based olg model, based on agénor (2015) and agénor and canuto (2015), that accounts for women’s time allocation between market work, child rearing, human capital accumulation, and home production. bargaining between spouses depends on relative human capital stocks. the model is calibrated and various experiments are conducted, including investment in infrastructure, conditional cash transfers, and a reduction in gender bias in the market place. the analysis shows raising female labour force participation with a package of pro-growth and pro-women policies could boost the growth rate by about 2 percentage points over time.
586@Achieving fiscal consolidation while promoting social cohesion in Japan@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrtpbs9fg0v-en@with gross government debt of 226% of gdp, japan’s fiscal situation is in uncharted territory and puts the economy at risk. japan needs a detailed and credible fiscal consolidation plan, including specific revenue increases and measures to control spending to restore its fiscal sustainability. the major concern on the spending side are social spending pressures in the context of rapid population ageing, making reforms to contain such spending a priority. much of the consolidation, though, will have to be on the revenue side, primarily through hikes in the consumption tax rate beyond the 10% now planned for 2017. fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by measures to promote social cohesion through the tax and benefit system and by breaking down labour market dualism. in particular, an earned income tax credit is a priority to assist the working poor.
587@Enhancing dynamism and innovation in Japan's business sector@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrtpbtkbhs1-en@innovation is key to boosting economic growth in the face of a rapidly ageing population. while japan spends heavily on education and r&d, appropriate framework conditions are essential to increase the return on such investments by strengthening competition, both domestic and international, and improving resource allocation. upgrading corporate governance would encourage firms to maximise profits and invest their large cash reserves. to promote open innovation in a global framework, it is necessary to improve universities and expand their role in business r&d, while increasing international collaboration in r&d from its current low level. venture capital-backed firms and start-ups should play a key role in commercialising innovation. to make venture investment a growth driver, it is important to expand the role of business angels and foster entrepreneurship. smes, which account for 70% of employment, should contribute more to innovation.
588@Vocational training and adult learning for better skills in France@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw21kjthln-en@france devotes a great deal of resources to vocational training for youths and especially adults, but the system is unduly complex and yields rather poor returns. the basic literacy and numeracy skills of many french adults remain weak in international comparison, with harmful effects on employment opportunities, wages and well-being. access to basic skills training is poor for those who need it most, many of whom come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. secondary vocational education and apprenticeship training still suffer from a serious image problem in the minds of french families, even though the latter have a good track record. the government has succeeded in ensuring that the number of apprenticeships is growing, but that is mostly due to those studying at the tertiary level or at least for a higher secondary diploma. the labour market outcomes of those with only shorter vocational qualifications are not good, and quality in that stream needs to improve. to do so better teachers and workplace trainers need to be attracted to the field, especially individuals who can better link practical experience and theoretical concepts. the financing of the adult training system involves complex collection mechanisms even following a major recent overhaul. making further changes will have to confront entrenched interests, even if the use of the training levy to finance business groups and unions has now ended. the goal is to direct more training funds to workers in small firms who have the weakest skills as well as to jobseekers, but this might be more easily achieved by shifting the funding base from a levy on employers to fiscal incentives or direct subsidies. there remains a need to align responsibilities for adult training with corresponding control over funds. workers are henceforth to be given personal training accounts in which they can accumulate rights to up to 150 hours of training. but the enormous number of providers and courses on offer calls for greater efforts to develop good guidance, evaluation and certification systems to ensure the training finally chosen is appropriate and of sufficiently high quality.
589@Structural policies and productivity: evidence from Portuguese firms@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw21mfp4kd-en@this paper provides empirical evidence on links between the productivity of portuguese firms and a number of policy variables in portugal. the analysis is based on a census of portuguese manufacturing companies, covering more than 40,000 firms between 2006 and 2011. the results suggest that a number of these variables matter for firm performance, including the number of procedures required to start a business, a more extensive coverage of collective wage bargaining agreements, the tax burden, tax compliance costs and the number of procedures required to enforce a contract.
590@Reducing inequality and poverty in Portugal@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw21ng3ts3-en@portugal has one of the most unequal income distributions in europe and poverty levels are high. the economic crisis has halted a long-term gradual decline in both inequality and poverty and the number of poor households is rising, with children and youths being particularly affected. unemployment is one of the principal reasons why household incomes declined. the tax and benefit system alleviates both inequality and poverty significantly. the tax system is markedly progressive, and recent tax reforms have likely increased this progressivity. transfer payments, especially non-pension benefits, are reducing inequality and poverty in a fairly efficient way. nonetheless, a number of adjustments could strengthen the equalising role of the benefit system, which is generally biased towards benefits for elderly people, while families with children should receive more support. the education system should provide more support to students at risk of falling behind to reduce grade-repetition and drop-out rates, while further increasing class sizes would be a reasonable way to generate savings without affecting learning progress much. scaling up vocational courses and adult education, including in the context of active labour market policies, could improve the capacity of many households to generate income and lead to a more equitable income distribution.
591@Boosting export performance in Portugal@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw21nm480q-en@in the years before the economic crisis, portugal had low growth, a decline in export competitiveness and rising imbalances that included a large current account deficit and a strong expansion of the non-tradable sector. strengthening export performance is therefore one of the principal challenges for portugal. a successful rebalancing of the economy is underway since portugal started an ambitious structural reform programme in 2011, but more needs to be done to build on the recent export success. this includes both measures to improve competitiveness, such as reforms in energy and services sectors, and measures to boost productivity growth, such as tax reform, improving the performance of the judicial system and better public support for research and development. given that exporting firms are typically the top performers in their industry, and have been so even before becoming exporters, it is important to avoid policies that could slow down the possibilities for high-performing firms to gain market share, such as the extension of collective wage agreements or the design of tax credits for research and development activities. support for small enterprises should also be designed to benefit start-ups with a strong growth performance, as well as firms that are increasing their participation in international trade.
592@Making New Zealand’s economic growth more inclusive@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw21ntclwc-en@new zealand generally performs well in terms of economic and social inclusion. it has high employment rates, and education and health-care systems work well for most. however, some new zealanders are stuck on low incomes and face material deprivation and multiple barriers to economic and social participation. the ranks of those falling behind increased in the wake of the economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which succeeded in halting the decline in gdp per capita relative to the oecd average but contributed to large increases in income inequality and poverty that have only been partially reversed since then. these developments have been aggravated by the rising burden of housing costs on low-income households. māori, pasifika and low-income households have also experienced slower rates of improvement in many health and education results. nz governments have made improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups a top priority in recent years. reforms are being made to facilitate the transition of welfare beneficiaries into work, increase the supply of affordable and social housing and enhance health and education outcomes for disadvantaged groups. these reforms go in the right direction and, in many cases, would be more effective still if complemented by other reforms.

594@Improving public sector efficiency for more inclusive growth in Latvia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw57p59bxx-en@this working paper explores avenues to improve public sector efficiency in latvia, a catching-up and ageing economy where spending needs are large. ensuring that spending allocated to core services (e.g. education, healthcare) is adequate to achieve convergence of policy outcomes to oecd upper standards is challenging. efficiency gains in the tax system could bring additional revenues. the tax base should be expanded by reducing informality, strengthening tax administration and increasing property and environmentally related taxes, which are low by international standards. to reduce unemployment and income inequality, the tax-benefit system should also be revised as it is now relatively regressive and the tax wedge on low-income earners is high. enhancing analytical, monitoring and assessment capacities should help to rein in wasteful expenditure and improve the prioritisation of spending. the reform of human resource management, public procurement, and state-local relations is also needed to deliver higher-quality and more cost-efficient public services.
595@Non-standard contracts, flexibility and employment adjustment: empirical evidence from Russian establishment data@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrw7j0mdlnt-en@this paper examines the use of two forms of non-standard work contracts in russia with data from an enterprise survey for the years 2009 to 2011. non-standard work contracts are less costly and more flexible for employers. internal adjustment in form of wage cuts or unpaid leave is not covered by the labour code and earlier practices to impose such measures are less tolerated. therefore more firms use non-standard work contracts for external flexibility. statistical analysis shows that companies using non-standard work contracts have similar unobserved characteristics and consider fixed-term contracts and agency work as complements. the main concern for policy is the growing danger of duality following the asymmetric distribution of adjustment costs for workers.

597@Fiscal constitutions: an empirical assessment@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxjctrxp8r-en@fiscal constitutions comprise the set of rules and frameworks guiding fiscal policy that are enshrined in a country’s fundamental laws. this paper compares the fiscal constitutions of 15 federal countries by empirically assessing five building blocks: 1) the power of sub-national governments to conduct their own fiscal policy; 2) the degree to which sub-national governments are held responsible for fiscal policy outcomes; 3) the extent to which sub-national governments can shape fiscal policy of the federal level; 4) the strength of intergovernmental budget rules; and 5) the stability of fiscal policy arrangements. the results can be summarised as follows: countries can be ranked along a single indicator, namely the degree of constitutionally guaranteed decentralisation. they can also be ranked along an indicator of institutional coherence which measures the extent to which building blocks “fit together”. from 1917 to 2013, fiscal autonomy and responsibility declined – except in the 80s and 90s of the 20th century – while co-determination and budget frameworks were strengthened, and institutional coherence rose. simple correlations suggest that the extent of decentralisation hardly affects fiscal outcomes such as deficits, debt or vulnerability to crises, while institutional coherence (or incoherence for that purpose) does.
598@Sustaining the economic expansion in New Zealand@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxqbg8c8np-en@the nz economy has performed well over the past few years, having achieved relatively strong gdp and employment growth. however, some constraints to sustaining this momentum beyond the short term are emerging in the fields of skills, housing and urban infrastructure. skills shortages have risen most in construction trades and management occupations. housing shortages are most severe in auckland, reflecting supply constraints in the face of population increases. as a result, prices are rising, reducing affordability. urban infrastructure, particularly for road transportation, is also strained. in this respect, policy has a role to play in expanding economic capacity by reducing supply-side constraints and fostering productivity growth. at times new zealand’s fiscal policy has been expansionary during upturns. ensuring that permanent spending or tax cuts are implemented in a sustainable manner would encourage the strong fiscal position that new zealand needs to meet potentially large macroeconomic shocks and long-run ageing-related costs. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic review of new zealand (www.oecd.org/newzealand/economic-survey-new-zealand.htm)

604@Relaunch productivity to boost growth and well-being@http://www.oecd.org/economy/relaunch-productivity-to-boost-growth-and-well-being.htm@6/7/15-the slowdown in productivity over the past decade has added to concerns about the long-term economic outlook. but new oecd research shows that policy reforms can revive the diffusion of innovation and make better use of human talent to clear the path for higher and more inclusive productivity growth.productivity is about “working smarter,” rather than “working harder,” and reflects the ability to produce more output by better combining inputs, thanks to new ideas, technological innovations and new business models. the oecd’s latest work on economy identifies impediments to future growth and then proposes policies to address them. “slower innovation is not the root cause of the current productivity slowdown,” oecd secretary general angel gurría said while launching the new research in mexico city. “the problem is the pace at which innovations spread throughout the economy, which we refer to as a breakdown of the diffusion machine. to relaunch productivity and reduce inequality, governments should act to help firms to better harness the forces of knowledge diffusion. they also need to focus on skills development and facilitate a more effective allocation of human talent to jobs,” mr gurría said.the new oecd research shows that the gap between high productivity firms and the rest has been increasing over time, suggesting that there are barriers to the diffusion of new innovations. labour productivity of the most advanced firms increased at an average annual rate of 3.5% in the manufacturing sector over 2000s, compared to just 0.5% for other less advanced firms within oecd economies.this gap is even larger in the services sector, and is of particular concern since the weight of services in most economies is rising, and services such as logistics, finance and communication are critical to firms’ participation in global value chains.diffusion is facilitated by global connectedness, experimentation with new ideas, knowledge-based capital and efficient resource allocation, but comes easier to firms in some economies than others.since the knowledge economy increasingly requires skills that many education systems are struggling to provide, countries will reap greater growth and equity benefits through policies that more effectively allocate skills. around one-quarter of workers in oecd economies report a mismatch between their existing skills and those required for their job. a better use of human talent supports the growth of innovative firms and could boost labour productivity by up to 10% in some economies, according to the report.the oecd identifies a number of policies to sustain productivity growth, including:• product market reforms and bankruptcy laws that do not excessively penalise failure, to improve firms’ incentives to experiment with new technologies, allocate resources more efficiently and maximise the benefits of participation in global value chains.• policies that make labour mobility easier. these include housing market policies that facilitate residential mobility, the promotion of adult and lifelong learning, and employment protection legislation that does not impose too heavy or unpredictable costs on hiring and firing. these policies can underpin the growth of productive firms, partly via lower skill mismatch.• more public investment in basic research, to support the continued emergence of breakthrough innovations and knowledge diffusion.• innovation policies that ensure a level playing field between incumbents and new entrants, which is often missing in existing incentive schemes. r&d tax incentives should be equally accessible and beneficial to incumbent, young firms and start-ups.the research into the future of productivity is part of the oecd's new approaches to economic challenges (naec) project, an organisation-wide reflection on the roots and lessons to be learned from the global economic crisis, as well as an exercise to review and update its analytical frameworks.for further information on the future of productivity, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
605@Raising competitiveness and long-term growth of the Slovenian economy@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxmlcv3237-en@the rapid growth after independence stopped in 2008 as the global crisis exposed important structural weaknesses. large state involvement and rigid labour and product markets lowered productivity. weak corporate governance and easy credit before the crisis led to high indebtedness and overinvestment. slovenia was slow to deal with the underlying structural problems. gradually, important reforms have been implemented which raised credibility of slovenia in the financial markets and boosted confidence. but economic recovery has been sluggish, many people are unemployed and living standards still remain below the pre-crisis levels. cost competitiveness and export market performance deteriorated, and there have been marked improvements only recently. better corporate governance and management practices in the state owned sector and privatisations can attract fdi and raise efficiency. low innovative activity could be boosted by more fdi, stronger framework for entrepreneurial activity and better start-up support. relatively high minimum wage is potentially reducing employment opportunities of low-skilled workers. limiting the minimum wage growth, and lowering the high tax wedge on labour income could boost employment. efficiency should be raised in early and tertiary education to enhance skills. despite generous public support, overall students’ performance could be improved and there are marked differences between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of slovenia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-slovenia.htm).
606@Macroeconomic uncertainties, prudent debt targets and fiscal rules@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxv0bf2vmx-en@the sharp rise in debt experienced by most oecd countries raises questions about the prudent debt level countries should target. it also raises questions about the fiscal frameworks needed to reach them and to accommodate cyclical fluctuations along the path towards a prudent debt target. the objective of this paper is to define long-run prudent debt targets for oecd countries and country-specific fiscal rules. to this end, a semi-structural macroeconomic model for oecd countries and primary balance reaction functions are estimated. the shocks derived from these estimations are used to assess uncertainties surrounding the development of macroeconomic variables. the model is simulated up to 2040 to derive the prudent debt target for each country and design country-specific fiscal rules.
607@Limits to government debt sustainability@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxv0fctk7j-en@the recent euro area sovereign debt crisis has shown the importance of market reactions for the sustainability of debt. the objective of this paper is to calculate endogenous government debt limits given the markets assessment of the probability to default. the estimated primary balance reaction function to growing debt has the “fiscal fatigue” property (a loosening fiscal effort makes the primary balance insufficient to support rising debt) at high debt levels. it is the combination of this feature of the primary balance reaction function with the market interest rate reaction to growing debt that determines the government debt limit beyond which debt cannot be rolled over. an application of this framework to oecd countries over the period 1985 – 2013 shows that current debt limits are high for most of the oecd thanks to particularly low current interest rates. it shows also for some countries that current debt levels are not sustainable without a change in government behaviour as compared to the past. most importantly, the framework illustrates the state contingent nature of debt limits and therefore the vulnerability of governments to a change in macroeconomic conditions and to market reactions.
608@Governments should target prudent debt levels and fiscal rules will help get there@http://www.oecd.org/economy/governments-should-target-prudent-debt-levels-and-fiscal-rules-will-help-get-there.htm@3/7/15-governments should set prudent debt targets to ensure that public finances serve to promote economic growth and stability, according to new oecd research.prudent debt targets and fiscal frameworks assesses the effect of debt on economic activity. taking into account various criteria, including the effectiveness of fiscal policy in pursuing counter-cyclical policy and the link between debt and the provision of public infrastructure, the oecd suggests that gross debt above about 80% of gdp has detrimental consequences for growth.the report lays out a robust analytical framework for setting prudent debt targets over the medium to long run and analyses the fiscal rules that can ensure that governments meet their objectives.“in large part because of sluggish growth, government debt has risen sharply during the recent crisis, to an oecd-wide average of 111% of gdp in 2013, which is the highest ratio since the aftermath of the second world war,” oecd chief economist catherine l. mann said while launching the report during the 15th annual rencontres économiques d’aix-en-provence. “our research has shown that such high debt levels have a negative impact on the economy. prudent debt targets for the medium-term provide the commitment tool that can re-assure markets, diminish risk premia and, most importantly, allow the use of active fiscal policy to stabilise and grow the economy in the short term.”empirical cross-country evidence presented in the report defines the “danger zone” or turning point at which the negative effects of debt kick in, for three groups of countries:• for higher-income oecd countries, a debt threshold range of 70 to 90% of gdp.• for euro area countries, a debt threshold of 50-70% of gdp, which takes into account their lack of control over monetary policy, the no-bail-out clause, the absence of debt pooling, a higher dependency on foreign financing and difficulties in adjusting to shocks.• for emerging economies, the debt threshold is even lower at 30 to 50% debt of gdp as they are exposed to capital flow reversals.the oecd provides guidance on the establishment of prudent debt targets, to avoid an over-shooting of the debt thresholds in the event of large, adverse shocks, while also providing near-term fiscal space. these prudent debt targets take into account uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic variables and are thus country-specific. prudent debt targets are on average 15 percentage points lower than debt thresholds, but with a wide variation across countries.the report also provides policy recommendations on setting up a fiscal framework that promotes fiscal discipline while allowing stabilisation policies, including to reduce the likelihood of recession in the near-term. in particular, the analysis shows that the combination of a budget balance rule and an expenditure rule seems to suit most countries well.“well-designed expenditure rules appear decisive to ensure the effectiveness of budget balance rules and can simultaneously foster long-term growth,” ms. mann said.further information on the oecd’s new research on prudent debt targets and fiscal frameworks is available from the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
609@Government debt indicators: understanding the data@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxv0ftbff2-en@there is no single “best” indicator for analysing general government debt. this paper examines the various issues in defining and measuring debt, and explores other data which could be useful, both within and beyond the general government debt concept, to better track and analyse fiscal risks and sustainability issues. measures from the broadest view of debt – gross financial liabilities – to the most comprehensive accounting of asset and liability positions – net worth – are all helpful metrics. so, too, are narrower data on specific issues, such as future pension liabilities, government guarantees and debt composition. better data reporting, including more complete metadata and broader data collection, are needed to allow for an arsenal of comparable debt concepts to better anticipate future fiscal pressures.

611@Low interest rates threaten solvency of pension funds and insurers@http://www.oecd.org/economy/low-interest-rates-threaten-solvency-of-pension-funds-and-insurers.htm@24/06/2015 - the current low interest rate environment poses a significant risk for the long-term financial viability of pension funds and insurance companies, as they seek to generate sufficient returns to meet promises, according to a new oecd report.the inaugural edition of the oecd business and finance outlook says the main concern is that pension funds and life insurance companies might become involved in the “search for yield” in order to match the levels of returns promised to policyholders and beneficiaries when interest rate were higher. this poses risks including insolvency. “generating the resources needed to confront the challenge of ageing populations will require a better global allocation of resources to the most productive investments but without excessive risk-taking,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría launching the report in paris (watch the live webcast). “above all, much remains to be done to strengthen the ability of the financial system to absorb shocks and avoid the bubbles and busts of recent decades” he added. (read the speech)the report also cites a very real risk that the current trend for companies to return cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, in order to boost short-term returns, means that capital will not be reinvested in more productive activities. this will hurt innovative investment and productivity growth. there are also risks building up from greater leverage and riskier investment in higher-yield and complex products with poor liquidity.over the next five years, pension funds are expected to grow 26% from an estimated usd 28.4 trillion in 2014 to usd 35.8 trillion in 2019; insurance companies’ assets will grow 33% from usd 28.2 trillion in 2014 to usd 37.7 trillion in 2019; and mutual funds will expand by 38% from usd 33.4 trillion in 2014 to usd 46.1 trillion in 2019.pension funds and insurers could face issues as high-yielding bonds are replaced by low-yielding bonds in their portfolios. lower interest rates will lead to lower returns for pension funds, which invest around 40% or more of their assets in fixed income securities, including lower yielding government bonds. if interest rates remain low into the future, funds and insurers may find their assets insufficient to meet their promises, unless they adjust their pension or payment promises.to reduce insolvency risks, insurers may need to offer lower guaranteed returns on new contracts to reduce liabilities and, in extreme cases, renegotiate current terms. pension plan sponsors could adjust or terminate existing plans and offer less attractive terms to new employees. defined benefit pension plan sponsors could increase contributions to funds. regulators and policy makers will need to remain vigilant to prevent excessive “search for yield”, says the report.the oecd business and finance outlook also analyses the rise of shadow banking and the impact of financial sector reforms since the crisis. it says there is still much to do to eliminate the current under-pricing of risk and to strengthen the ability of the system to absorb future shocks. these should involve ensuring strong capital bases and making key financial sector firms less interconnected by, for example, separating shadow banking from more traditional deposit banking and implementing policies to limit critical leverage.other chapters in the outlook address bank and capital market financing of smes; mnes in the shifting global business landscape; market-based financing of corporate investments; and pro-competitive policy reform for investment and growth.the oecd business and finance outlook has been launched during a high-level roundtable. for more information, please visit : www.oecd.org/daf/oecd-business-finance-outlook.htm.an embeddable version of the report is available, together with information about downloadable and print versions of the report.for more information, journalists should contact the oecd media division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).
612@Financial sector must promote inclusive growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/financial-sector-must-promote-inclusive-growth.htm@17/06/15-finance is a key ingredient of modern economies, but too much finance may hamper economic growth and worsen income inequality, according to new research from the oecd.the oecd’s latest work on finance and inclusive growth analyses 50 years of data to demonstrate the variable effects that further expansion of different types of finance can have on both economic activity and inequality.“the global financial crisis has raised deep questions about the influence of finance on economic activity and the distribution of income,” oecd chief economist catherine l. mann said while launching the new research in london. “what our research has shown is that avoiding credit over-expansion and improving the structure of finance can lead to improvements in both economic and social well-being.”the oecd identifies a number of risks to long-term growth posed by an over-reliance on bank lending, versus other types of market-based finance, such as bonds and equities. these include misallocation of capital, by funding investments with low profitability; magnifying the cost of implicit guarantees for too-big-to-fail banks; drawing highly talented workers away from sectors with greater productive potential; and generating boom-bust cycles. at today’s level of financial development, further expansion of bank credit to the private sector is shown to slow growth in most oecd countries. a rise of bank credit by 10% of gdp translates into a gdp growth rate that is 0.3 percentage points less than would otherwise be the case, according to the oecd. greater levels of stock market financing, on the other hand, are still seen to boost growth. an increase in stock market capitalisation by 10% of gdp is, on average across oecd and g20 countries, associated with a 0.2% rise of gdp growth.bank loans slow economic growth more than market-based credit, while credit to households – which is primarily aimed at the real estate sector – is a stronger drag on growth than credit to businesses.whereas financial expansion can help low-income individuals fund their projects and home ownership, it tends more to drive inequality. people with higher incomes can and do borrow more than those on lower incomes, and the benefits from growth in stock markets accrue more to high-income households who tend to have more wealth in equity. similarly, the financial sector pays high wages, which are above what employees with similar profiles earn in the rest of the economy, increasing income inequality. in europe, financial sector employees make up 20% of the top 1% earners, but are only 4% of overall employment.the oecd identifies reforms to make the financial sector more stable and enable it to contribute to strong and equitable growth. these include:• greater use of macro-prudential instruments to prevent credit overexpansion, and the supervision of banks to maintain sufficient capital buffers.• measures to reduce explicit and implicit subsidies to too-big-to-fail financial institutions, through break-ups, structural separation, capital surcharges or credible resolution plans.• reforms to reduce the tax bias against equity financing and to make value added tax neutral between lending to households and businesses.this paper on the link between finance and growth is part of the oecd's new approaches to economic challenges (naec), an organisation-wide reflection on the roots and lessons to be learned from the global economic crisis, as well as an exercise to review and update its analytical frameworks.further information on the oecd’s new research on finance and inclusive growth is available from the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
613@Productivity spillovers from the global frontier and public policy: industry level evidence@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js03hkvxhmr-en@for much of the second half of the twentieth century, labour productivity grew rapidly in most oecd economies, fuelled by the adoption of a large stock of unexploited existing technologies. however, the slowdown in productivity growth over the past decade underscores the idea that as economies converge toward the global technological frontier, the ability to capitalise on new innovations developed at frontier becomes more important. using industry level data for 15 countries over the period 1984-2007, this paper augments the neo-schumpeterian framework to identify the relevant channels and policies that shape an economy’s ability to learn from the global productivity frontier. an economy’s ability to benefit from frontier innovation is a positive function of its degree of international connectedness, ability to allocate skills efficiently and investments in knowledge based capital, including managerial capital and r&d. productivity growth, via more effective learning from the global frontier, is supported by a policy framework that promotes efficient resource allocation – including lower barriers to entrepreneurship, efficient judicial systems and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure – and fosters the creation of markets for seed and early stage finance. innovation policies that support basic research and facilitate the absorption of external knowledge for firms – including via university-industry r&d collaboration – also enhance spillovers from the global productivity frontier, and consequently, productivity growth.

617@Strengthening investment key to improving world economy’s B-minus grade, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/strengthening-investment-key-to-improving-world-economy.htm@watch the presentation given by angel gurría, oecd secretary-generalwatch the press briefing given by catherine l. mann, oecd chief economist3/06/2015 - global growth will gradually strengthen towards its pre-crisis trend rate by late 2016 as activity becomes more evenly shared across the major economies and overall external imbalances are less marked than in the run-up to 2007, according to the oecd's latest economic outlook.labour markets are gradually healing in the advanced economies and risks of deflation have receded.but the global economy can be characterised as only achieving a muddling-through “b-minus ” grade. global growth in the first quarter of 2015 was weaker than in any quarter since the crisis. and although this softness is seen as transitory, productivity growth continues to disappoint, reflecting in part tepid business investment which has weakened the spread of new technologies.weak investment in many economies is hindering an increase in consumption, job creation and wage rises, and eroding the prospects for long-term sustainable growth. “the global economy is projected to strengthen, but the pace of recovery remains weak and investment has yet to take off” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said. “the failure to trigger strong, sustainable growth has had very real costs in terms of lost jobs, stagnant living standards in advanced economies, less vigorous development in some emerging economies, and rising inequality nearly everywhere.” (read full speech) the outlook says increases in capital spending are needed to push economies onto a higher growth path. for policy makers, translating investment into sustained growth also requires paying attention to low-wage workers, as well as tackling the consequences of rising inequality for education, a key factor undermining growth in the longer term.the oecd sees global growth at 3.1% in 2015, rising to 3.8% in 2016. this is less than the 3.6% and 3.9% foreseen in the previous outlook in november 2014, largely on account of the unexpected weakness seen in the first quarter of 2015. global growth is expected to pick up through 2015 and 2016 thanks to low oil prices, widespread monetary easing and a reduction in the drag from fiscal consolidation in the major economies.us gdp growth is projected to be 2.0% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016, a downward revision from the november 2014 forecast of 3.1% this year and 3.0% in 2016. while the stronger dollar and adverse weather weighed on growth in early 2015, unemployment continues to fall. supportive monetary policy and lower oil prices should continue boosting demand.output in the euro area is expected to rise by 1.4% this year and 2.1% in 2016, more than forecasted in the previous outlook, when the projections were 1.1% for 2015 and 1.7% for 2016. bolder-than-expected monetary easing by the ecb has been accompanied by substantial depreciation of the euro, which should reinforce the positive demand effect of a pause in fiscal consolidation and the drop in oil prices.japanese growth is projected at 0.7% in 2015 (compared with 0.8% in the previous outlook) and 1.4% in 2016 (1.0% previously). lower oil prices, stronger exports reflecting the weaker yen and real wage gains are among the factors driving the recovery.in china, the 2015 gdp growth forecast has been revised down to 6.8%, from 7.1% in the november outlook, and to 6.7% from 6.9% for 2016. the deceleration reflects the restructuring underway in the chinese economy as services replace manufacturing and real estate investment as the main driver of growth.growth in india is expected to remain strong and stable in 2015 (at 7.3%) and 2016 (7.4%). the recessions in russia and brazil are projected to give way to low but positive growth in 2016.“to move from a “b-minus” grade to an “a” means boosting investment in order to create jobs and stimulate consumption”, said oecd chief economist catherine mann. “it means putting in place structural policies to raise productivity and encourage competitive markets as part of a package combining monetary and fiscal policies that deliver adequate demand growth and reduce policy uncertainty.”further information about the economic outlook is available here or from the oecd’s media division (tel: +33 1 4524 9700). a online read-only version is also available.this embeddable data visualisation is available at: www.compareyourcountry.org/oecd-economic-outlook please use the ‘+share/embed’ button to customize this tool for your country and language and to generate the embed code for your website.

620@Incorporating anchored inflation expectations in the Phillips Curve and in the derivation of OECD measures of equilibrium unemployment@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1gmq551wd-en@incorporating anchored inflation expectations in the phillips curve and in the derivation of oecd measures of equilibrium unemploymentinflation has become much less sensitive to movements in unemployment in recent decades. a common explanation for this change is that inflation expectations have become better anchored as a consequence of credible inflation targeting by central banks. in order to evaluate this hypothesis, the paper compares two competing empirical specifications across all oecd economies, where competing specifications correspond to the ‘former’ and ‘new’ specification for deriving measures of the unemployment gap which underlie the oecd’s economic outlook projections. the former oecd specification can be characterised as a traditional ‘backward-looking’ phillips curve, where current inflation is partly explained by an autoregressive distributed lag process of past inflation representing both inertia and inflation expectations formed on the basis of recent inflation outcomes. conversely, the new approach adjusts this specification to incorporate the notion that inflation expectations are anchored around the central bank’s inflation objective. the main finding of the paper is that the latter approach systematically out-performs the former for an overwhelming majority of oecd countries over a recent sample period. relative to the backward-looking specification, the anchored expectations approach also tends to imply larger unemployment gaps for those countries for which actual unemployment has increased the most. moreover, the anchored expectations phillips curve reduces real-time revisions to the unemployment gap, although these still remain uncomfortably large, in the case of countries where there have been large changes in unemployment.e31: macroeconomics and monetary economics / prices, business fluctuations, and cycles / price level; inflation; deflation; c22: mathematical and quantitative methods / single equation models; single variables / single equation models; single variables: time-series models; dynamic quantile regressions; dynamic treatment effect models; diffusion processes; j64: labor and demographic economics / mobility, unemployment, vacancies, and immigrant workers / unemployment: models, duration, incidence, and job search; e24: macroeconomics and monetary economics / consumption, saving, production, investment, labor markets, and informal economy / employment; unemployment; wages; intergenerational income distribution; aggregate human capital; aggregate labor productivity
621@The stabilisation properties of immovable property taxation: evidence from OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js0cqq93djg-en@this paper contributes to the scarce literature on the macroeconomic effects of property taxes, in particular on the relationships between property taxes, house prices and the wider economy. the paper first estimates a fiscal reaction function which analysis the reaction of property tax revenues to house prices. it then analyses a house price reaction function looking at the relation of how house prices react to changes in property taxes. for a set of oecd countries, the results suggest that property taxes tend to be a-cyclical or slightly pro-cyclical. they provide a stable revenue source for sub-central governments but do not stabilise the economy. the results also suggest that an increase in property tax revenues or in the tax revenue-to-gdp share slows down house price increases and that higher property taxation tends to reduce house price volatility.
622@Making the most of natural resources in Indonesia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js0cqqk42ls-en@indonesia abounds with natural resources. but the unique nature of its geography, coupled with the lack of transport infrastructure, makes their exploitation challenging. moreover, a lack of investment, protectionism and an unwieldy regulatory environment are all inhibiting the sector from reaching its full potential. agriculture has been held back by low productivity, under-investment, unclear property rights on land, ill-advised trade regulations, misplaced support for staples and restrictions on foreign ownership. by pursuing crop diversification, encouraging co-operation between smallholders and large estates and easing constraints on foreign investment, indonesia could raise its farmers’ productivity. fossil fuels have become central to indonesia’s energy policy and its main source of export revenues. growing environmental concerns, both domestically and internationally, combined with subsiding coal prices and the on-going shale gas revolution, call into question the sustainability of such a strategy. indonesia should increase its energy efficiency and further develop gas to plug the gap until sufficient renewable energy, especially geothermal, comes on line. government control over the oil industry via state-owned pertamina should be gradually reduced. clarifying, streamlining and publicising simple regulations in energy and minerals, especially regarding land rights and on-shore processing, and removing foreign-ownership restrictions will help bring much needed investment. the pressure on the environment that natural resource exploitation is creating should be addressed by increasing the share of gas and renewables in the energy mix, properly defining property rights and regulations regarding forest land, and implementing a positive implicit carbon price. more resources should be devoted to combating widespread illegal mining and deforestation. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm)
623@Reforming the pension system to increase coverage and equity in Colombia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js0cqrr97s4-en@colombia is one of the most unequal countries in latin america. the high level of informality in the labour market and many characteristics of the pension system leave many elderly in poverty. only formal-sector employees earning more than the relatively high minimum wage are covered. linking benefits to at least the minimum wage makes the system costly and reduces the provision of annuities by insurance companies as it is difficult to insure against changes in the minimum wage. the government has recently introduced a matching-contribution scheme (beps) for informal workers and vulnerable retiring aged people who have not contributed enough to be entitled to a pension. moreover, the coverage of the old-age minimum income support has been extended but at the cost of lowering the already modest benefits. more reforms in the pension system are needed to extend coverage while eligibility to the beps and the minimum income support should be expanded to guarantee old-age income for more colombians. in the medium term an in-depth pension reform is required. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of colombia.

624@Middle-class economics@http://www.oecd.org/economy/middle-class-economics.htm@in 2014, the us economy added more jobs than in any year since the 1990s. in fact, this longest streak of job growth on record has persisted into 2015. inflation-adjusted wages are up by 1.4% annually over the last two years, more than twice the pace of the last recovery. but this is still not enough to make up for decades of subpar gains for middle-class families–a challenge shared by many other oecd economies. president obama’s approach to what he has termed “middle-class economics” is about remedying this decades-long challenge for the future. in the us, median incomes are up 17% since 1973. two facts suggest that this increase falls far short of what we should have been able to accomplish: from 1948 to 1973 middle-class incomes rose 98%; and from 1973 to 2013 productivity increases should have allowed an ordinary worker to purchase 82% more per hour of work, well above the increase actually experienced by typical families. family incomes critically depend on three factors: the overall productivity growth in the economy, the degree to which those gains are broadly shared and labour force participation. these three factors have evolved differently in different economies, but all three have trended worse across a wide range of oecd economies in recent decades. the largest factor in the us has been the slowdown in productivity growth. from 1948 to 1973, productivity grew by 2.8% annually, but since 1973 it has slowed to 1.8%, in part reflecting disruption from the oil shocks and the breakup of the bretton woods monetary system. but the slowdown is also the result of policy choices: for example, the us made significant investments in the interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s, but in subsequent decades infrastructure investment as a share of gdp decreased substantially. the second largest factor in the household income slowdown in the us has been the increase in inequality. in 1973, the bottom 90% of households received 68% of the nation’s income, but receives just 53% today. increased inequality partially reflects technology, but also the policy choices we have made– including the failure to maintain expansion in education just as unionisation and the real minimum wage were declining. the third factor in the us is the falling labour force participation. although the post-2007 decline–primarily caused by demographic changes and the recession–has garnered the most attention, prime-age male participation has been falling since the 1950s and prime-age female participation since the 1990s. these trends reflect societal forces, but also choices we have made about our training systems, tax laws and policies on workplace flexibility. of course, we cannot change the last 50 years, but we can continue the work we began in the depths of the crisis–including investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, tax cuts for working families, steps to slow the growth of health costs, and more. the initial indication is that these policies are working. not only has the us enjoyed stronger growth and faster job gains in recent years, but it is leading a global revolution in technology and innovation, such as in cloud computing, mobile devices, personalised medicine and advanced materials to make major advances across our economy. president obama has proposed a range of other measures to boost productivity growth, including expanding overseas markets for our exports, reforming our business tax system, encouraging investments in technology, expanding education and reforming our immigration system. while higher productivity is necessary for sustained increases in middle-class incomes, it is not sufficient, which is why president obama is also calling for steps to expand opportunity like an increased minimum wage, expanded tax credits for low-income workers and the middle class, and a fairer tax system overall. enabling more people to participate in the workforce is critical, a goal that will be furthered by better child care; more flexible workplace practices, including paid leave and paid sick days; a tax system that supports secondary earners; and a better system for training and job matching. the facts are clear: a strengthening economy is helping to boost jobs and pay, but a focus on increasing shared growth is essential in the us as elsewhere in the oecd to achieving the goal of higher incomes for middle-class households.
625@Making Colombia’s tax policy more efficient, fair and green@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js0cqs9605g-en@tax revenues at 20% of gdp remain low compared to other latin american countries and the oecd average and tax evasion is pervasive. lower oil revenues and the expiration of a number of taxes are putting strains on the budget at a time when social and development spending needs are rising. heavy reliance on corporate income taxes reduces investment. at the same time, the redistributive impact of taxation is reduced because most of income and wealth taxes are paid by firms rather than households. therefore, colombia needs a comprehensive tax reform that boosts revenues and shifts the tax burden to support more inclusive and green growth. tax loopholes and exemptions that reduce the tax base and favour mainly the rich should be reduced significantly. strengthening the tax administration will help reduce evasion. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of colombia.

626@What impedes household investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1j15g2f8n-en@energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies provide important opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. however, households fail to take up many clean energy investments that are cost-effective. this paper reviews different explanations for apparent underinvestment in energy efficiency that have been put forward in the literature. while investments in renewable energy technologies are typically not (yet) profitable, many of its drivers are similar to those that determine energy efficiency investments, and the two types of investment are therefore assessed jointly. the paper also provides new evidence regarding barriers to investment in energy efficiency based on the oecd survey on household environmental behaviour and attitudes. finally, policy solutions that would help overcome some of these barriers are also presented.
627@Recent trends in productivity in China – shift-share analysis of labour productivity growth and the evolution of the productivity gap@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1j15rj5zt-en@shift-share analysis of labour productivity growth and the evolution of the productivity gapthe chinese economy has been undergoing fundamental structural changes since the start of reforms in 1978. an increasing number of farmers first got engaged in off-farm activities and then started to migrate to cities in the 1990s in search of jobs. such movement of labour from less to more productive jobs boosted overall labour productivity and growth. agglomeration and scale economies further pushed up productivity. while the productivity gains from internal migration will diminish gradually over time, urbanisation is likely to remain an important source of productivity growth in the coming decade or so. this paper first decomposes labour productivity growth over 2000-11 into a within-industry, a shift and a cross effect in a number of countries and compares china with other countries over this period. this shift-share analysis also allows a comparison of within-sector productivity gains across a large number of sectors and countries. labour productivity alongside total factor productivity is also discussed from the perspective of its gap with the united states and growth rate over 2000-11 and in comparison with other briics economies. in this analysis, manufacturing and service industries are looked at separately. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of china www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htmj24: labor and demographic economics / demand and supply of labor / human capital; skills; occupational choice; labor productivity; d24: microeconomics / production and organizations / production; cost; capital; capital, total factor, and multifactor productivity; capacity
628@Assessing China's skills gap and inequalities in education@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1j1805czs-en@in recent years, many tertiary graduates have had difficulties finding a job, while factories have been struggling to recruit workers. notwithstanding rapidly increasing education attainment, graduates’ skills do not seem to match those demanded by the market. moreover, structural changes in the economy aggravate the shortage of skills in newly emerging industries. while the problem is widely recognised, empirical studies of the issue are scarce and the skills gap has not been quantified. this paper aims at gaging the skills and knowledge gap of tertiary graduates of universities and vocational colleges across china. it also looks at the employment and wage prospects of graduates with different educational backgrounds. inequalities in educational opportunities, stemming in particular from the urban-rural divide and to a lesser extent from the social background, shape careers and lives. the best primary and middle schools are located in the biggest cities and until recently children competed for a place at such schools. in third and fourth-tier cities or in rural areas, in contrast, there are fewer choices and thus less chance to get into a “model” high school or a top university. the family background also tends to have an impact on the choice of a school or profession and on future earnings. this paper discusses various aspects of inequalities related to the place of upbringing, family background and geographical area. micro-level data analysis is complemented by an investigation into inequalities of various aspects of education at the city and county levels. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of china www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm
629@"Providing the right skills to all in China – from ""made in China"" to ""created in China"""@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1j18g4tlx-en@providing the right skills to all in china from “made in china” to “created in china”china has made impressive strides in education in recent decades, even though the accumulation of human capital has lagged behind that of physical capital. going forward, access to and quality of education will be key to sustain economic convergence with the most advanced economies and to offset the drag exerted by population ageing. this will require addressing a number of problems. access to pre-school education is still far from universal. migrants’ children as well as rural and poor families are still at a major disadvantage at every step of the education ladder. the focus on rote learning and exams remains excessive. more bridges are needed between vocational and general education. graduating students often struggle to find a job matching their expectations and employers do not always find the requisite skills. despite a soaring number of chinese patents, the quality of most patents is still low and innovation output is weak. reforms are underway to address these problems but further progress is needed in various areas against the backdrop of rapidly evolving market demands and the development of the knowledge economy. among the priorities are more and better oriented funding of education, giving greater opportunities to children with a socio-economic or physical disadvantage, reducing the role of after-school tutoring, focusing less on memorisation and more on creativity, enhancing the appeal of the teaching profession, improving students’ information on labour market prospects, developing workplace training, making greater use of online education potential, and more effectively nurturing research and innovation. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of china www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htmi25: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / education and economic development; i00: health, education, and welfare / general / health, education, and welfare: general; o31: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth / innovation; research and development; technological change; intellectual property rights / innovation and invention: processes and incentives; i20: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / education and research institutions: general; h52: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies / government expenditures and education; i24: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / education and inequality; j24: labor and demographic economics / demand and supply of labor / human capital; skills; occupational choice; labor productivity; o: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth; o30: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth / innovation; research and development; technological change; intellectual property rights / innovation; research and development; technological change; intellectual property rights: general; i22: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / educational finance; financial aid; i23: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / higher education; research institutions; i21: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / analysis of education; i28: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / education: government policy

631@A snapshot of China’s service sector@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1j19lhbkl-en@the share of the tertiary sector in china’s value added has increased steadily, overtaking the share of the secondary sector in 2013. with increasing incomes, the share of services is expected to grow further as at higher incomes a larger share of income is spent on services. in addition to final demand, intermediate demand can be another driving force for service industries. as liberalisation leads to a greater role for the market in allocating resources, service industries are expected to become more competitive and therefore it may become cheaper to outsource services than to produce them in-house. liberalisation will likely also lead to greater specialisation to remain competitive, thereby making specialised services available for outsourcing. this will likely spur the development of some high value-added logistics services such as warehousing or order handling. by the same token, professional services such as accounting or engineering are also likely to benefit from a greater reliance on the market and greater competition. in the envisaged transition from “made in china” to “created in china”, the service sector is expected to play a prominent role. to that end, the service sector is gradually being provided a more even playing field as privileges for manufacturing industries are being withdrawn and a more equal treatment of producers across sectors is being adopted. this paper provides a snapshot of the service sector, its size, the ownership of its firms, and productivity across types of firms depending on ownership, sector, age, size and geographical region. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of china www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm.
632@Africa: making growth more inclusive hinges on unlocking potential of local economies, says the African Economic Outlook 2015@http://www.oecd.org/economy/press-release-african-economic-outlook-2015.htm@‌abidjan, côte d’ivoire, 25 may 2015 – with africa’s population set to double by 2050, modernising local economies will be vital to make the continent more competitive and to increase people’s living standards, according to the african economic outlook 2015, released at the african development bank group’s 50th annual meetings.surpassing most regions in spite of the global financial crisis, african economies will grow by 4.5 per cent in 2015 and may reach 5 per cent in 2016, converging with asia’s current growth rates. however, lower oil and commodity prices, uncertain global conditions, the consequences of the ebola outbreak in west africa and domestic political uncertainties could delay an expected return to pre-2008 levels of growth. foreign direct investment (fdi) is forecasted to reach usd 73.5 billion in 2015, underpinned by increasing greenfield investment from china – which remains africa’s largest trade partner after the european union. the report also shows an increase in intra-african and outward fdi flows. south african companies are the leading investors on the continent.“african countries have shown considerable resilience in the face of global economic adversity. for future growth to be sustainable and transformative will require that its benefits are shared more equitably among the population and that governments continue to pursue policies that promote economic stability,” stated steve kayizzi-mugerwa, acting chief economist and vice-president of the african development bank.human development levels in africa have increased since 2000, with 17 out of 52 countries reaching middle or high levels of development. but the region’s poverty rates remain stubbornly high while progress in health, education and income are uneven. huge inequalities persist between and within countries, and between women and men. in many areas, low productivity and investment, the absence of infrastructure and rural-urban networks and too few jobs outside of the agricultural sector are holding back economic and development progress.the continent’s demographic boom is exacerbating these challenges. by 2050, both cities and rural communities in africa will see their population grow drastically, with the countryside gaining an estimated 400 million people.for instance, the report states that over the next 15 years, 370 million youth will enter sub-saharan africa’s labour markets, making it necessary to create many more jobs and opportunities for savings and investment. in addition, that population growth, combined with climate change, will exert increasing pressure on natural resources, such as food, water and land.projected workforce growth in sub-saharan africa, north africa, china, india, europe and the united states, 2010-50the report argues that past efforts to promote regional development through territorial management, infrastructure development and decentralisation have been scattered and had limited impact. as a result, the potential of africa’s regions, which includes river basins, border areas and key rural-urban corridors, remains unfulfilled.“african economies could benefit from mobilising the wide and extraordinary untapped potential of their diverse regions. putting people and places at the centre of policy-making may improve africa’s competitiveness and the well-being of africans” said mario pezzini, director of the oecd development centre.transforming economies will require exploring more productive sectors, through promoting manufacturing, developing services, creating strategies for green growth or modernising the agricultural sector.in addition, tackling spatial inequalities would require implementing policies that cut across sectors. these include diversifying rural economies and linking them with cities, through the promotion of value chains and trade corridors. they also include unlocking domestic financing, developing transport and communication and investing in basic social services.“inclusive and sustainable growth is a fundamental aspect of africa’s post-2015 development agenda for economic and social transformation,” said abdoulaye mar dieye, the director of the regional bureau at the united nations development programme (undp). “we need to invest in building economic opportunities, including at the local level. and especially those of young women and men who are the architects of tomorrow’s africa.”the report calls for strengthening skills and education, addressing exclusion through the development of targeted social protection measures, and promoting universal access to sustainable energy and technology.the african economic outlook is produced annually by the african development bank (afdb), the oecd development centre and the united nations development programme (undp).

634@Skill mismatch and public policy in OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1pzw9lnwk-en@this paper explores the relationship between skill mismatch and public policies using micro data for 22 oecd countries from the recent oecd survey of adult skills (piaac). results suggest that differences in skill mismatch across countries are related to differences in public policies. after controlling for individual and job characteristics, well-designed product and labour markets and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise business failure are associated with lower skill mismatch. given the negative relationship between skill mismatch and labour productivity, reducing skill mismatch emerges as a new channel through which well-designed framework policies can boost labour productivity. skill mismatch is also lower in countries with housing policies that do not impede residential mobility (e.g. transaction costs on buying property and stringent planning regulations). greater flexibility in wage negotiations and higher participation in lifelong learning as well higher managerial quality are also associated with a better matching of skills to jobs.
635@Labour market mismatch and labour productivity: evidence from PIAAC data@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1pzx1r2kb-en@this paper explores the link between skill and qualification mismatch and labour productivity using cross-country industry data for 19 oecd countries. utilising mismatch indicators aggregated from micro-data sourced from the recent oecd survey of adult skills (piaac), the main results suggest that higher skill and qualification mismatch is associated with lower labour productivity, with over-skilling and under-qualification accounting for most of these impacts. a novel result is that higher skill mismatch is associated with lower labour productivity through a less efficient allocation of resources, presumably because when the share of over-skilled workers is higher, more productive firms find it more difficult to attract skilled labour and gain market shares at the expense of less productive firms. at the same time, a higher share of under-qualified workers is associated with both lower allocative efficiency and within-firm productivity – i.e. a lower ratio of high productivity to low productivity firms. while differences in managerial quality can potentially account for the relationship between mismatch and within-firm productivity, the paper offers some preliminary insights into the policy factors that might explain the link between skill mismatch and resource allocation.
636@Maintaining an efficient and equitable housing market in Belgium@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js30ttdx36c-en@housing conditions in belgium are among the best in oecd countries according to the better life index, as dwellings are of high quality and large, and housing costs are average. however, the steep increase in house prices since 2003 has put market access for first-time buyers under pressure. housing affordability is also deteriorating for the poor, as demand for social housing has not been met while the private rental market has become expensive. as a result, access to housing is at risk of becoming less equitable if the young and poorer people are priced out. affordability for poorer people could be improved by expanding the regional rental allowance schemes. in parallel, scaling down the disproportional support for homeownership would free up public resources and reduce the bias towards homeownership. other challenges to the efficiency of the housing market are posed by the high level of greenhouse gas emissions due to the old age of the housing stock and the low residential mobility, which harms the labour market and contributes to congestion and air pollution. to maintain an efficient housing market, policies should aim at increasing building densities in residential areas. tilting taxation from transaction to recurrent taxes would lower barriers for residential mobility and contribute to labour market flexibility. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of belgium (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-belgium.htm)
637@Determinants of the low female labour force participation in India@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js30tvj21hh-en@the low and declining female labour force participation rate in india despite strong growth over the past decade is puzzling and stands out among emerging markets. at the same time greater economic participation of women can be a source of inclusive growth, and wellbeing. assessing determinants of the labour force participation of women in india can open important policy insights. this paper first describes key employment trends in india by gender. then the potential determinants of female labour force participation are identified based on literature, basic statistics and econometric techniques. given the large regional differences in india the analysis is also conducted by region and between rural and urban areas. in contrast to other briics or oecd countries, education and incomes are negatively correlated with female labour for participation in india. apart from lack of jobs, social and cultural factors keep women outside the labour force. other determinants relate to infrastructure, access to finance, labour laws and rural employment programmes. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of india (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-india.htm).
638@Reforming the tax on immovable property: taking care of the unloved@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js30tw0n7kg-en@the tax on immovable property recently started to regain its former significance, but the tax yield still remains low, with slightly more than 1% of gdp and wide variation across countries. against this background this paper surveys property tax policy in oecd countries and analyses the efficiency, distributional and stabilisation properties of property tax. despite rising house prices, property tax revenues are modest, because tax values of property are set below market values; and because myriads of tax exemptions reduce the tax base and tax revenues further. while property taxes are considered the least harmful to growth, a pure land tax is preferable to a tax on investment. property taxes can be anything from progressive to regressive, depending on tax incidence and the distribution of immovable property across income groups. property taxes tend to stabilise house prices, although the effect is rather small. finally, property taxes can underpin sustainable land use. political economy factors largely explain resistance against property tax reform, which, among others, might include measures for poor and cash-strapped households. property taxes are an overwhelmingly sub-national tax, and property tax reforms that include reforms of intergovernmental fiscal frameworks may turn out to be more successful.
639@Efficiency and contestability in the Colombian banking system@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js30twjgm6l-en@despite progress in the past decade, financial markets in colombia remain relatively small and shallow. in particular the banking system suffers high intermediation costs, which limit constrains access to finance by households and firms. this paper explores some of the causes behind these intermediation costs. an accounting decomposition of the lending-deposit spread suggests that the levels of contestability and efficiency are low. a more in-depth analysis using stochastic frontier and data envelopment analyses confirm that the efficiency of the colombian commercial banking system is low compared to other emerging markets and oecd economies with similar levels of development. furthermore, econometric estimates of market contestability support the hypothesis that contestability in colombia is subpar. finally, the paper also explores some of the potential determinants of efficiency and contestability for a sample of the 24 countries over the period 2004 – 2013. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of colombia.

640@"Fiscal decentralisation in Colombia: new evidence regarding sustainability, risk sharing and ""fiscal fatigue"""@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js30tzp18kj-en@colombia has engaged in a sustained process of fiscal decentralisation over the past decades. this paper analyses three aspects of fiscal performance for colombia’s departments. first, it studies the sustainability aspects of subnational finances by estimating a fiscal reaction function. evidence is presented that the current framework is conducive to fiscal sustainability, especially after the reforms in the late 1990s and early 2000s. second, the paper analyses the impact of transfers and oil and mining royalties and the effort to raise own tax revenues at the departmental level. overall, there is little evidence of a negative effect of transfers from the central government on departmental tax revenue, the so-called “fiscal fatigue”. finally, the paper presents evidence of a limited degree of risk sharing of departmental idiosyncratic shocks, as transfers from the central government are mostly pro-cyclical. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of colombia.

641@What we've learned–and have still to learn–from the financial crisis*@http://www.oecd.org/economy/what-we-have-learned-from-the-financial-crisis.htm@financial crises do more than impose huge costs: they have bigger and more insidious effects. we face big challenges in maintaining the supply of global public goods as the world integrates. but these challenges will not be managed successfully if we do not first overcome the legacy of the crisis. moreover, all this must be done at a time of transition in global power and responsibility from a world dominated by western powers to one in which new powers have arisen. inevitably, such crises also help undermine belief that a globalising economy is of benefit to the vast majority of people. they make people anxious and angry and rightly so. angry and anxious people are not open to the world. they want to hide in their caves, together with similarly angry people. that is what happened in the 1930s. financial crises are the events most likely to bring the world back there. equally inevitably, crises undermine confidence in the elites. in democratic societies, a tacit bargain exists between elites and the rest of society. the latter say to the former: we will accept your power, prestige and prosperity, but only if we prosper too. a huge crisis dissolves that bargain. the elites come to be seen as incompetent, rapacious, or, in this case, both. the political results may come slowly. but come they will. here then are three huge failures of the western elites. first, the economic, financial, intellectual and political elites misunderstood the consequences of headlong financial liberalisation. lulled by fantasies of self-stabilising financial markets, they not only permitted but encouraged a huge and, for the financial sector, profitable bet on debt. the policymaking elite failed to appreciate the risks of a systemic breakdown. the financial elite was discredited by both its behaviour and its need to be rescued. the intellectual elite was discredited by its failure to anticipate a crisis or agree on what to do after it had struck. the political elite was discredited by their willingness to finance the rescue, however essential it was. the decline in confidence in these elites is even worse if the methods used to rescue the economy then make the parts of the elite most associated with the crisis richer than before. this undermines the sense of fairness that underpins the political economy of capitalism: there has to remain a belief that success is earned, not stolen or handed over on a platter. second, the past three decades have seen the emergence of a globalised economic and financial elite that has become ever more detached from the countries that produced them. in the process, the glue that binds democracy–the notion of citizenship–has weakened. the narrow distribution of the gains of economic growth risks exacerbating this development. third, in creating the euro, the europeans took their project beyond the mundane into something far more important. the economic troubles of crisis-hit economies are evident: huge recessions, extraordinarily high unemployment, mass emigration and heavy debt overhangs. the constitutional disorder that has resulted remains insufficiently emphasised. within the eurozone, power is now concentrated in the hands of the governments of the creditor countries, principally germany, and a trio of unelected bureaucracies–the european commission, the european central bank and the international monetary fund. the peoples of adversely affected countries have no influence upon them. the politicians notionally accountable to them are powerless. this divorce between accountability and power strikes at the heart of democratic governance. the loss of confidence in the competence and probity of elites inevitably reduces trust in democratic legitimacy. people feel even more than before that the country is not being governed for them, but for a narrow segment of well-connected insiders who reap most of the gains and, when things go wrong, are not just shielded from loss but impose massive costs on everybody else. this creates outraged populism, on both the left and the right. yet willingness to accept shared sacrifice is likely to be still more important in the years ahead than it was before the crisis. the economies of the western world are poorer than they imagined ten years ago. they must look forward to a long period of retrenchment. making that both be and appear fair matters. every effort must be made to restore economies to growth, on both the demand and supply sides. every effort must be made, too, to ensure that a similar crisis will not recur without eliminating those aspects of an open world economy and integrated finance that are of benefit. this will require more radicalism than most recognise. we must not only learn the lessons about how the world economy went awry. we must also act upon them. if we do not, next time a big crisis arrives even our open world economy could end in the fire. *extract from martin wolf’s 2014 book, the shifts and the shocks: what we've learned–and have still to learn–from the financial crisis, published by allen lane in the uk and the penguin press in the us.
642@Strengthening skill use and school-to-work transitions in the Czech Republic@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1pz2xnm6b-en@the education system has reacted slowly to changes in labour market needs, leading to an increasing number of school leavers without sufficient qualification. in addition, declining pisa scores and a rising share of low achievers are raising concerns about the quality of the future labour force. these factors play a role in the stalled income convergence process. indeed, practices such as early tracking, streaming and low transferability between academic tracks hamper employability, human capital accumulation and social mobility. in the vocational education and training system, resources continue to be allocated on a historical basis. a more endogenous adjustment of the system to better align students’ qualifications with labour market needs requires active participation of social partners, students and education institutions. the rapid expansion of tertiary education without a corresponding increase in resources has led to fears about declining quality. quality in tertiary education can be fostered by modifying the accreditation system, introducing student fees, strengthening the links with the private sector and foreign research networks and publicising information on labour market outcomes by field of study and higher education institution. measures to better balance family and work lives can improve career options for women and therefore reduce the current tensions between having children and full time labour market participation of younger women. this could also ease the coming labour shortages associated with population ageing. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic review of the czech republic (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-czech-republic.htm).
643@Taxation and investment in Colombia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js1pz3d0j8r-en@the colombian corporate tax system is highly complex and distortive. the effective tax burden on businesses is very high due to the combined effect of the corporate income tax, the corporate surtax introduced in 2012 (cree), the net wealth tax on business assets and the value added tax (vat) on fixed assets. indeed, in addition to high statutory taxes on corporate income, formal sector businesses are subject to a wealth tax on their net assets and to a production-based vat system under which vat paid on the purchases of fixed assets is not creditable against output vat. calculations in this paper find that the total marginal effective tax rate reaches about 60% for equity-financed investments. such a high effective corporate tax burden is likely to deter investment and to further encourage tax evasion in the future and therefore calls for a fundamental business tax reform. this paper also reviews the other key elements of the capital income tax system in colombia. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of colombia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-colombia.htm)
644@Addressing Growing Inequality through Inclusive Growth: Insights for the US and Beyond@http://www.oecd.org/economy/addressing-growing-inequality-through-inclusive-growth-insights-for-the-us-and-beyond.htm@president kennedy once said that ‘the rising tide lifts all boats’. but across much of the world the last three decades have seen the tide of growth lift millionaires’ yachts, only to leave the rafts of the poorest stuck in the mud.let me give you a few numbers to spell out exactly what i mean. across the 34 advanced economies that make up the oecd, the average income of the richest 10% is now almost 10 times that of the poorest 10%, up from 7 times 25 years ago.[i] inequality has risen even in traditionally egalitarian countries, like norway or sweden.the situation in emerging markets and developing countries is even worse. the income gap between the top and bottom 10 percent hits 50 times in brazil, around 30 times in mexico, and a staggering one hundred times in south africa.inequality is also a burning issue here in the united states. this is a country founded on egalitarian principles. it is nation known as a land of hope and opportunity, a place where – with some smarts and hard work – everyone has the potential to become the next warren buffet or bill gates. that is the american dream!yet today, even as the us continues to lead the recovery from the great recession, there is a nagging sense that things are not getting better for everyone, as wealth and opportunity become disproportionately concentrated in the hands of those at the top.this is borne out in the data. thirty years ago, the average income of the top 10 percent here in the us was 12 times higher than the bottom 10 percent. at the last count that figure had risen to 16.5 times.what is more, those at the very top are doing even better. america’s top 0.1 percent currently lay claim to around 8 percent of national pre-tax income. to put that in perspective, that’s around twice the share of their equivalents in canada, the united kingdom and switzerland. this gives the us the dubious honour of being some way out in front as the most unequal among rich countries.the oecd’s numbers tell a clear-cut story of how our traditional economic growth agenda has neglected inclusiveness. yet to begin to tackle this problem, we have to understand that inequality is not just about money. it touches every area of people’s lives.take education as an example. right across the oecd, children from poor families are more likely to attend sub-standard schools than their wealthier peers. this initial disadvantage follows them, and many end up with lower paid jobs. in the us, around 15% of the variation in student performance is explained by socio-economic background. that is about the oecd average, but it’s still too high!and to make matters worse, life-expectancy in oecd countries is correlated with education level. our data show that at age 30, those with the lowest levels of education are on average expected to live roughly six years less than their well-educated counterparts.here in the us, the most well-educated white males are expected to live as many as 14 years longer than the most poorly-educated african-american males. this is first and foremost a profound social tragedy, but it also has severe economic consequencesevidence suggests that when rising inequality perpetuates exclusion, it leads to poorer economic performance. recent oecd research estimates that rising inequality has knocked as much as 7 percentage points off cumulative gdp growth in the us since 1990. that’s slightly better than mexico, the uk or norway, but it still amounts to well over a trillion dollars of lost output. and that can be directly traced to families with lower incomes slipping behind because they underinvest in education and skills.inequalities also impose a cost on our democracies, hitting trust and engagement. across the oecd the percentage of people who trust their government slumped to 42% in 2014. that’s hardly a rave review of an inclusive political process!clearly, something should be done. i can tell you from my own experience that governments right across the world are waking up to the dangers of growing unequal. just last month i was in beijing, to launch an oecd report on inclusive growth in china, which the government will use to inform their thirteenth next five year plan. today, many countries- from sweden, to korea, and new zealand - are talking about how to tackle inequalities as an urgent priority. talk is important, but what about action?the oecd can help! our inclusive growth initiative sets out to support member countries in turning inclusiveness into a fundamental driver of growth. it builds on some of the lessons we have learnt in over two decades of analysing and assessing inequalities.and as mr dervis - a member of our advisory group on inclusive growth – can attest, the results of our work have clearly shown that there doesn’t have to be a trade-off between growth and equality. on the contrary, if you want sustainable long-term economic growth, then you need policies that include all members of society in it, especially the disadvantaged.our flagship report all on board: making inclusive growth happen, sets out a number of areas where governments can make a difference to promote inclusive growth. let me share a couple of concrete examples with you, that are particularly relevant to the us.• first, there is a real need to ensure that everyone - regardless of wealth, race, creed or gender - has access to high quality education and training opportunities throughout their lives. the oecd’s programme for international student assessment (pisa) underlines that excellence through equity is possible. experience from the nordic countries, singapore, or shanghai suggests that expanding low-income families’ access to high-quality pre-schools makes a real difference. in the us, the plan for early education for all americans is a crucial step in this direction and efforts should continue.• second, job policies aimed at bringing disadvantaged groups into employment can also promote growth overall. measures to help women better reconcile their work and family lives will be key to creating an economy where everyone can make ends meet. such measures could take many forms, but granting access to paid family leave nationally and expanding access to quality early childhood education and care would be an important start.• third, health is intimately linked with income and employment. making health insurance coverage universal is essential to reducing health inequalities. yet the most vulnerable also need additional attention from policy makers to compensate for bad health outcomes and non-financial barriers to health care.• finally, governments could also do more to raise incomes for those on low wages by expanding the earned income tax credit, and putting in place higher minimum wages. more generally, there is ample scope for wide ranging reforms of tax and transfer systems that would not blunt incentives to work, save or invest.we can no longer afford to think about growth and inclusiveness as if they were separate, or even worse, opposite concepts. the real test of a healthy economy is not the extent to which it empowers those at the top to expand their fortunes, but rather the chances it bestows on those at the bottom to create theirs.

646@The opportunities and challenges of greener growth: Getting the whole policy package right@http://www.oecd.org/economy/opportunities-challenges-greener-growth.htm@"climate change and, more generally, environmental damage have quantifiable economic and health costs, which weigh on long-term growth and well-being. if left unchecked, climate change is projected to decrease global gdp by 0.7 to 2.5% by 2060. at the same time, the costs to society of air pollution already appear substantial–equivalent to some 4% of gdp across oecd countries and even higher in some rapidly developing economies. yet global action in the environmental domain proceeds only slowly–too slowly to be up to the challenges we face. why is it so?one primary goal of environmental policies is to encourage firms and households to reduce the damage they do to the natural environment, for instance, by adopting new technologies, ideas and products that improve environmental performance. policymakers have long feared that such policies would be a constraint on their country’s competitiveness–a number of empirical studies attempted to attribute a significant part of the 1970s productivity slowdown in the united states to the increasing role of environmental policies. but a shift is starting to take place which should make environmental policies politically easier to advance.one reason for the shift is that the claims of overall negative effects of environmental policies have found little backup in research. in fact, anecdotal evidence has been rather comforting: growth did not collapse after the implementation of numerous environmental policies over the years, be it unilateral introduction of environmental taxes or broader global actions, such as the montreal protocol to reduce ozone layer depletion.moreover, new compelling evidence from the oecd indicates that the economy and the environment can be improved together. based on the experience of a large set of countries, it shows that productivity has generally not been negatively affected by policies that promote care for the environment. yes, policies require some temporary adjustments, but these tend to wash away within a couple of years.as importantly, the most productive and technologically advanced firms (and industries) tend to actually gain from tighter environmental policies, an outcome likely reflecting their superior ability to grasp the new opportunities by innovating and improving their products, but also by relocating their production abroad. in contrast, the least productive firms–which generally use their resources less efficiently–may see a temporary fall in their productivity growth, possibly as they require more investments to cope with the more stringent environmental requirements. some of the least productive firms may cease to operate. still, if resources are swiftly reallocated to young and expanding firms, the overall impacts will not necessarily be negative and can be positive, both for the economy and the environment, particularly if policies are in place to enable entry and exit of firms and to support employment.our evidence on international trade and the environment adds another positive perspective to this picture of the effects of environmental policies. a recent analysis shows that more stringent environmental policies spur the development of a market for a whole range of equipment specifically intended for preventing and abating pollution. indeed, it concludes that stringent regulation positively affects countries’ specialisation in environmental products, which is a rapidly expanding global market. increased trade in such products can spur global improvements in environmental quality. in fact, when combined with stringent, well-designed environmental policies, open trade can form a vital channel for reducing pollution and spurring growth both globally and domestically.economic dynamism is crucial to ensure such positive outcomes, and policy design can do a lot to contribute. the overall policy framework should be oriented to encourage growth of young and dynamic firms, and the development of new products and ideas that fulfil tighter environmental standards. such policies include minimising barriers to market entry and competition, improving access to financing, and promoting trade and innovation to ensure those new products and ideas flow in. but, equally importantly, the actual design of environmental policies matters. the keywords are flexibility and competition: market-based instruments, such as green taxes, that leave the choice to the firm as to which clean technology to use, tend to have more robust positive effects on productivity. on the contrary, while rules to spur markets are important, policies that lead to excessive and unnecessary green (red) tape or provide advantages to incumbents, such as laxer norms or subsidies that prop up dirty and inefficient firms, can prevent both environmental and economic progress.many oecd countries appear to be waking up to these new policy options for doing better in designing both general framework policies and environmental policies. similarly, countries can also do much more to align policies across many different areas, such as taxation, investment, land-use or sectoral policies, to be more consistent with environmental goals. they can learn from countries where even stringent environmental policies are also competition-friendly and can support the entry and scaling up of new cleaner technologies, products and business ideas.a complementary approach to enabling the labour market to adjust is also important, particularly as higher productivity firms will need to be able to attract the correctly skilled workers in order to maximise their advantages. in sum, reforming environmental policies in this way can facilitate the achievement of both environmental and economic objectives and help forge a healthier, more prosperous planet.the author would particularly like to thank tomasz kozluk of the oecd economics department for his input.oecd, iea, itf and nea (forthcoming), ""aligning policies

(read the full speech).the oecd highlights productivity increases as the key to unlocking future growth, particularly given japan's ageing population and already shrinking workforce. labour productivity is surprisingly low – 25% below the average of the top half of oecd countries - considering that japan has very high levels of secondary and tertiary education and r&d spending. to remedy this, policies should aim to increase the return on r&d investment through improvements to the innovation ecosystem. this will require better corporate governance, reduced product market regulation and more labour market mobility.given population ageing, japan must make better use of all workers. the female labour force participation rate is still 20 percentage points below that of men, one of the biggest gender gaps in the oecd. ensuring that female participation rates converge to those of men by 2030 would drastically limit the expected fall in labour supply and boost economic growth, the survey said.further remedial action will be necessary, however, to ensure fiscal sustainability in japan over the long term. the gross government debt reached 226% of gdp in 2014, the highest level ever recorded in an oecd country. given the budget deficit of around 8% of gdp, japan’s debt ratio is set to rise further into uncharted territory. with public debt service now the biggest item in japan's central government budget, a detailed and credible fiscal plan is essential to put the debt burden on a downward trajectory over the medium term. any such plan should include fiscal consolidation sufficient to achieve a primary surplus by financial year 2020, notably through efforts to cut healthcare costs and reduce the growth of social spending. further increases in the consumption tax and a broadening of the base for personal income taxes will also be necessary, the survey said.furthermore, the survey recommends tackling labour market dualism and better targeting public social spending on those who need it most, including through the introduction of an earned income tax credit for low-paid workers. this can help fight poverty and promote social cohesion. the necessary fiscal consolidation effort should take these social concerns into account.an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible (in english, french and japanese) on the oecd’s web site at: http://oecd.org/japan/economic-survey-japan.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.an embeddable version of the economic survey is also available, together with information about downloadable and print versions.for further information on the economic survey, contact naoko kawaguchi, media officer in the oecd tokyo centre (+81 3 5532 0026), or the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700)."
648@Effects of economic policies on microeconomic stability@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js3f5cwj3jb-en@economic policies shape how much people earn as well as how stable their income and jobs are. the level and stability of earnings both matter for well-being. standard economic aggregates do not measure accurately the economic uncertainty which households are facing. this paper shows that household-level economic instability is only very loosely related to macroeconomic volatility. it uses several household-level databases to document how pro-growth reforms influence household-level economic stability. movement from less to more productive processes and firms is at the heart of economic growth, which suggests a trade-off between growth and micro-level stability. certain policy changes boost growth but increase micro-level instability: they include reductions in tax progressivity or social transfers (including unemployment benefits) as well as moves from very to moderately tight restrictions on the flow of goods and services and on the dismissal of regular workers. however, the analysis also uncovers that moving to highly competitive policies generally reduces micro-level instability.

651@Federal-state relations in Australia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4h5mx7bg0-en@australia’s inter-governmental fiscal relations have gradually moved towards greater centralisation. state governments receive sizeable transfers from the federal government and own revenues only partially cover their expenses. finding the right balance between federal control and state autonomy in public service provision and its financing has not been easy. over time various compromises have somewhat blurred responsibilities in various functional areas or reduced incentives to raise sub-national revenues potentially affecting public sector efficiency and service quality. a better balance, one in which central government has less steerage over state activities and states have more financing autonomy but also bear increased responsibility is likely to improve outcomes. federal-state shared responsibilities continue to affect the efficiency of healthcare service delivery in particular. a clearer delineation of roles in shared functions and possibly a reallocation of responsibilities in some cases, are important. there is also scope to reduce federal grant conditionality further to contain red tape and enhance transparency and give the states a more flexible allocation of funds. strengthening states’ revenueraising by broadening existing tax bases would promote efficiency. consideration could be given to the introduction of a state-level income tax. the government’s current review of the federal system, focusing on both spending and tax responsibilities, is welcome, as is the “whole of government” approach to the process. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of australia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-australia.htm).
652@Sharing the fruits of growth with all Mexicans@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4h5njs131-en@in 2013 the mexican government embarked on a major reform agenda which, if fully implemented and pushed forward, will help mexico break out from a recent history of economic stagnation and high levels of poverty and inequality that has hampered the quality of life of its citizens. indeed, compared with other oecd countries, mexico performs poorly in indicators that are essential to a good life, often resulting in traps that hinder growth and well-being. the government has introduced major structural reforms to fight poverty, improve the quality of education, create more jobs in the formal sector and move towards a universal social security system. this is a substantial accomplishment. however, mexico needs to build a more inclusive state. this implies raising more tax revenue (without necessarily increasing tax rates) to expand social protection. it also means promoting an inclusive labour market to reduce informality and increase female labour market participation; inclusive schools to reduce educational gaps; inclusive health systems so that health care quality no longer depends on employment status; and inclusive cities to reduce geographical segregation. this working paper relates to the 2015 oecd economic survey of mexico (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-mexico.htm).

659@France must continue its reform process to boost growth and jobs@http://www.oecd.org/economy/france-must-continue-its-reform-process-to-boost-growth-and-jobs.htm@02/04/2015 - france has begun implementing a series of important pro-growth structural policy measures, but boosting medium-term growth will require more ambitious action to reform the labour market, curb high levels of public spending and taxation and create jobs, according to the latest oecd economic survey of france.the survey, presented in paris by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and french minister of finance and public accounts michel sapin, points out that france’s annual per capita gdp growth has been below the oecd average for the better part of two decades and unemployment has been well above the oecd average.the survey praises reforms that have been undertaken in recent years to improve productivity and competitiveness, such as the crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi (cice), the pacte de responsabilité et de solidarité, the administrative simplification efforts, and the strengthening of competition as well as vocational training and apprenticeships. the current bill « pour la croissance, l’activité et l’égalité des chances économiques » and the reform of social dialogue are also steps in the right direction.while the french economy is projected to grow by 1.1% in 2015 and 1.7% in 2016, the survey says that the outlook is fragile and insufficient to bring down unemployment significantly.“france has considerable economic assets, which have helped it maintain a high standard of living while keeping income inequality at low levels,” mr gurría said. “the economic recovery is underway, but unemployment is at high levels, and public finances remain weak, with chronic deficits and rising public debt. achieving stronger, more inclusive, sustainable growth will require additional reforms that substantially improve the outlook for growth and job creation.” (read the full speech in french)further labour market reforms should be the top priority. regulations on open-ended contracts hinder labour mobility and create significant duality with workers on temporary contracts, notably younger workers. to address this, france can simplify and shorten layoff procedures, notably through reforms to the labour courts, the survey said.the survey also recommends that france lower public spending - which represented 57% of gdp in 2014, among the highest levels in the oecd - to allow tax cuts, especially on labour. substantial savings are possible through a rationalisation of the organisation, spending and mandates of local government, and holding down social spending on the health care, pension and unemployment insurance systems. despite the recent measures to lower the tax wedge on labour, it remains amongst the highest in the oecd, except for low wages. shrinking the tax wedge and avoiding discretionary increases in the minimum wage will improve the competitiveness of the cost of labour. with complex governance and weak quality controls, the vocational education system is not adequately providing skills and training to those who need it most. more can be done to strengthen quality control, and ensure adequate funding and proper oversight of vocational education and training programmes, including apprenticeships. reducing barriers to competition, opening closed sectors and continuing reforms to simplify the business environment will improve the outlook for growth, equity and job creation.  in addition to these reforms, better governance and targeting of social and educational policies towards the most vulnerable, in particular to address the high levels of educational performance inequality linked to socio economic background, would enable france to fulfil its ambitious economic and social objectives. an overview of the economic survey, with the main conclusions, is freely accessible on the oecd’s web site at: http://oecd.org/france/economic-survey-france.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey. a one-page summary of the survey can be consulted at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/france-2015-flyer.pdf. an embeddable version of the economic survey is also available, together with information about downloadable and print versions. for further information on the economic survey, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700). oecd secretary-general angel gurría and french minister of finance and public accounts michel sapin

and in south asia – where it is growing by 12 million a year - which will become a source of major stress if they do not have enough jobs.• environmental and resource challenges, particularly the expected increase in severe drought incidence. by 2050, more than 40% of the world’s population will live under severe water stress.• new security concerns – such as cybercrime and terrorism –threaten livelihoods in addition to traditional conflicts due to geopolitical unrest.despite these challenges, the report is optimistic that livelihoods can be secured if innovative initiatives are taken. it makes a call for action at all relevant levels to seize these opportunities:• at the global level, efforts must continue to increase co-ordination and co-operation to create the right conditions for livelihoods in many fields, from financial stability to climate change, from international trade to migration, from water governance to cyber security.• national governments can be enablers of vibrant societies and a back-stop in hard times. for example, to address the jobs challenge, governments could enhance opportunities for lifelong learning and promote livelihood portfolios made up of part-time work, paid training, and unemployment benefits.• local initiatives help secure livelihoods, for example, by supporting a vibrant shared local economy in which individuals can survive through a patchwork of entrepreneurial and social initiatives involving exchanges, barters and virtual service marketplaces. the introduction of local currencies (also known as complementary or community currencies) for example, could shelter local communities from the turbulence of volatile global financial markets.for further information, journalists should contact bochra kriout (tel.: +33 145 24 82 96) at the oecd development centre.securing livelihoods for all: foresight for action is supported by the rockefeller foundationthe development centre occupies a special place within the oecd and in the international community. it is a forum where countries at different levels of development come to share their experience of economic and social development policies. the centre contributes expert analysis to the development policy debate. the objective is to help decision makers find policy solutions to stimulate growth and improve living conditions in developing and emerging economies.

667@Determinants of female entrepreneurship in India@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4rfh5gtbq-en@this paper examines the nature and determinants of female entrepreneurship in india based on survey data. the first part assesses basic characteristics of female entrepreneurship in india, while the subsequent sections analyse key determinants of female entrepreneurship based on the literature, and test their importance at the state level in india with the support of regressions on panel-data. it also reviews existing policies bearing on female entrepreneurship and makes recommendations for further policies in this area. entrepreneurship can create new economic opportunities for women and contribute to overall growth and exit from poverty. the potential flexibility in time use from entrepreneurship can also facilitate balancing work and family obligations for women. however, entrepreneurs, both male and female, are relatively scarce in india compared to peer countries, and tend to work in small units often outside the formal sector. while many of the barriers to entrepreneurship are common to both genders (access to capital and business networks, adequate training and facilities) female entrepreneurs face gender biases stemming from socio-economic factors or specific biases in laws such as inheritance laws.
668@The changing role of the exchange rate for macroeconomic adjustment@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4rfhjf15l-en@recent episodes of large exchange rate movements, such as for japan or the united kingdom, have typically not been associated with large changes in trade balances and despite the polarisation of international investment positions large currency fluctuations during the global crisis of 2008-09 did not cause significant financial dislocations. this paper presents empirical evidence that for a number of oecd countries firms’ increasing participation in global value chains may have contributed to reducing exchange rate pass-through to the terms of trade, which may in turn have contributed to reducing the response of trade balances to exchange rate changes. further empirical evidence suggests that over the past two decades large net external debtor countries, including emerging market economies, have reduced net aggregate foreign currency exposures, thereby limiting direct financial effects of exchange rate fluctuations through the valuation of external assets and liabilities. however, sizable increases in foreign currency borrowing for a number of emerging market economies in the wake of the global crisis of 2008-09, including by non-financial corporations, suggest that large exchange rate movements may nonetheless cause financial stress for exposed sectors and entities that may percolate through the financial system despite limited aggregate exposures.

(read the full speech in french).the report investing in youth: tunisia – strengthening the employability of youth during the transition to a green economy reviews labour market policies and the most promising social measures for removing barriers to employment. it makes four key recommendations:• improve youth employability with effective labour market and social policies. measures that can be adopted in this field include an unemployment benefit system; the expansion and proper targeting of unconditional cash-transfer programmes (national welfare programme to support vulnerable families) in order to provide a social safety net; strengthened public employment services and support for entrepreneurs.• increase the attractiveness of hiring young people. this requires a constructive social dialogue that takes into account the situation of young people; reducing the gap between public and private sector wages and benefits; more targeted use of salary subsidies to encourage recruitment and more precise targeting of these subsidies at the underprivileged, underqualified and long-term unemployed.• increase the effectiveness of vocational education and training to support the transition from school to work. vocational education and training, for example, should be made more attractive to prospective students, by facilitating transfers between general and vocational courses and by improving the quality of options in the final years of secondary education.• promote job prospects for young people in the green sector. the focus should be on areas that will create jobs or where existing skills can be adapted. these would most likely be renewable energy, waste and recycling, eco-tourism and exports of organically farmed produce, and the construction sector.according to investing in youth, around two young workers in five are unemployed, and one in four young people is not in employment, education or training – a figure almost double that of most oecd countries. youth employment in north africa is a shared challenge, and tunisia has everything it needs to serve as a model for this part of the world.the secretary-general also presented to government ministers oecd draft reports on open governance and global value chains.for further information about tunisia: a reform agenda to support competitiveness and inclusive growth and investing in youth: tunisia, please contact spencer wilson or caroline tourrier in the oecd’s media division (+33 1 4524 9700)."

672@The conduct of monetary policy in the future: instrument use@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4w293c46j-en@the set of monetary policy instruments has expanded since the start of the global financial crisis in the many oecd economies. against this background, this paper analyses whether some of the new instruments should be retained in the long term when broader financial stability objectives are likely to feature more prominently as monetary policy goals than prior to the crisis. it also assesses if these new instruments should be used during the transition to this situation and when countries are stuck in persistent stagnation. in the post recovery situation, central banks could ultimately revert to targeting short-term market rates with small balance sheets. this might, however, require changes to monetary policy implementation due to new liquidity requirements. the transition to this situation will be lengthy and will require a mixture of liquidity draining instruments. alternatively, they could adopt a floor system, which may benefit financial stability. the use of unconventional measures as a substitute for policy rate cuts will no longer be needed unless countries remain in persistent stagnation. nevertheless, in the post-recovery normal, extended collateral and counterparty eligibility could be sustained, and currency swap lines among central banks could be expanded.
673@Boosting growth and reducing informality in Mexico@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4w28dnn28-en@mexico has embarked on a bold package of structural reforms that will help it to break away from three decades of slow growth and low productivity. major structural measures have been legislated to improve competition, education, energy, the financial sector, labour, infrastructure and the tax system, among many, and implementation has started in earnest. if fully implemented, these reforms could increase annual trend per capita gdp growth by as much as one percentage point over the next ten years, with the energy reforms having the most front-loaded effects. beyond this, a second wave could go further to tackle other structural bottlenecks. these challenges include reducing stringent regulation – particularly at the local level – and addressing corruption and weak enforcement of legal rights. the justice system is often slow and inefficient. and in the agricultural sector, strict land use restrictions and the structure of subsidies promote inefficiency. moving even closer towards oecd best practices could increase potential growth by another percentage point annually.
674@Reforms can support growth and equity in Latvia, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/reforms-can-support-growth-and-equity-in-latvia.htm@25/02/2015-the latvian economy is among the fastest-growing in the euro area, but continued reforms will promote a rapid and sustainable pace of convergence with upper-income countries while limiting the risk of repeated boom-and-bust cycles, according to the oecd economic survey of latvia.the survey, presented in riga by oecd chief economist catherine l. mann and latvian economics minister dana reizniece-ozola, notes that latvia bounced back strongly from the global economic crisis and has shown noteworthy capacity to adjust to external shocks. despite a slowdown in 2014 and a challenging international environment, gdp is projected to grow by 3.2% in 2015 and 3.9% in 2016.“latvia’s transformation and economic convergence since the 1990s has been impressive, but there is more to do”, ms mann said. “reducing high levels of inequality and the risk of poverty will be challenging. continued efforts on structural policies are needed to dismantle the various obstacles hindering latvian firms’ productivity and sustainable convergence with europe. and additional policies should be put in place to limit the repetition of boom-bust cycles.”the survey, which feeds into latvia’s ongoing oecd accession process, points out that inequality is high, compared to other oecd countries, and risks of poverty or social exclusion are above those seen in the eu. better targeting of social benefits to low-income households is needed to address poverty risks, while lowering taxes on low-paid jobs would promote formal employment, reduce inequality and include more latvians in the social security system.productivity gains – notably via international trade, integration into global value chains and investment into knowledge based capital – will be essential to stimulate further income convergence, the survey said. improving the business environment, by reducing entry barriers and red tape, should be the first step. improving governance of state-owned enterprises and ensuring connectivity of network industries will also be key, the survey says.planned reforms of vocational education and training, including the extension of work-based learning, should proceed to improve the skills and capacities of latvia’s workforce.as recent history has shown, latvia is highly exposed to external shocks, which can be costly to both the economy and the state of public finances, with deficits and debt both rising during the crisis. to counter a boom-bust cycle, the oecd recommends that latvia build up a reserve to cope with future adverse macroeconomic shocks; maintain adherence to its fiscal discipline law, which aims to ensure that budgetary policies do not accentuate fluctuations in the economy; and continue careful monitoring of the financial sector, particularly as concerns risks related to the large share of non-resident deposits.an overview with the main conclusions is available at http://www.oecd.org/countries/latvia/economic-survey-latvia.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.the economic survey of latvia feeds into the country’s ongoing oecd accession process, which was launched in october 2013, on the basis of the may 2013 decision by the oecd council to open accession discussions with colombia and latvia.latvia is currently working through an accession roadmap, which sets out the terms, conditions and process for its accession to the organization. the accession roadmap calls for a series of in-depth reviews conducted by 21 oecd technical committees, which, in turn, will provide a formal opinion to the oecd council on latvia’s willingness and ability to implement oecd standards and of its policies and practices as compared to oecd best policies and practices in the relevant area.these reviews are seen as an opportunity to support the latvian authorities in pushing forward reforms in line with oecd standards and best practices. there is no set timeline or end date for the accession process, and progress made ultimately depends on the ability of latvia to respond to recommendations made by oecd committees, formed by its members, in order to successfully complete the technical reviews.the 34 member oecd promotes policies that improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. the organisation provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems.the oecd's current members are: australia, austria, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, luxembourg, mexico, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, slovak republic, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.for further information on latvia’s accession process, go to: http://www.oecd.org/countries/latvia/oecd-sets-out-roadmap-for-latvias-membership.htm.

679@A constant market share analysis of Spanish goods exports@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js69lb4b5mt-en@the constant market share analysis framework is used to decompose changes in spain’s share of the global market for goods exports into competitiveness and structural effects (i.e. the impact of specialisation, either in product or geographical terms) over 1996-2013. as other high-income countries, spain has experienced competitive pressures from china and other emerging economies that have resulted in a loss of global market share. nevertheless, the loss has been smaller than in other european advanced economies, thanks to better competitiveness. by contrast, the structure of geographic markets to which spain exports, with a large-weight on relatively slow-growing areas and a small weight on fast-growing emerging countries, has exerted a negative impact on spanish exports. in the same vein, the product structure, focused on relatively slow growing product lines, has not been conducive to better export performance either. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of spain (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-spain.htm).
680@G20: Remarks for Session 2 - Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/g20-remarks-session-2-framework-for-strong-sustainable-and-balanced-growth.htm@deputy prime minister babacan, ministers and governors, ladies and gentlemen, we are still far from the g-20’s objective of achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth: the world economy grew at just over 3% in 2014, below its long-run average. the fall in oil prices and some recent policy measures will help, but some large economies face a risk of persistent stagnation, a “low growth trap” in other words. at the same time, growing divergences in policy stances are increasing the risk of financial instability.the g-20 made huge progress towards strong and sustainable growth one year ago in sydney through its historic commitment to raise g-20 gdp by at least 2% by 2018, the so-called “2 in 5” objective.by the time of the brisbane summit, your national growth strategies delivered more than 800 new specific structural reform commitments. these measures were assessed by the oecd - working closely with the imf - to deliver the 2% objective.however, hard work is needed to implement these commitments and achieve that boost to gdp – not to mention that in light of the ongoing unfavorable trends, we may need additional efforts, at some point, to achieve the 2% target. in this context, the oecd very much welcomes and supports the 3 “i”s agenda of the turkish presidency. first, i am glad that the turkish presidency has put “implementation” at the heart of its agenda. your citizens count on you to deliver these measures that will lead to higher incomes, more jobs and less unemployment.delivering on these commitments is also a vital test of the g-20’s credibility. the world is watching you! in this regard, the latest issue of our going for growth report, that i have just released with deputy prime minister babacan, points to mixed trends:• the pace of structural reforms has slowed in the majority of advanced countries over the last two years, after a period of significant acceleration in the aftermath of the crisis. hopefully, this slowdown mostly results from the need to ensure that past legislated reforms are implemented. but let’s not fool ourselves: this is also a reflection of domestic reform fatigue, as reflected by recent political events;• by contrast with advanced countries, the pace of reforms has been accelerating in major emerging-market countries, reflecting the awareness of bottlenecks and constraints to growth and the need to reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in commodity prices and capital flows.the oecd is already working closely with g-20 members to ensure that there is a robust accountability assessment for the growth strategies. we stand ready to help countries with implementation. working with the imf, we will report back later in the year on progress towards the 2%.while the g-20 must deliver what it has already promised, members’ efforts to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth must continue to move forward.first, the risk of persistent stagnation in some economies and lacklustre growth globally, combined with weak labour markets and inflation, underlines the case for a stronger policy response. monetary, fiscal and structural policies must be ambitious and work together - beyond current efforts - to put the global economy on a stronger growth path. let me emphasize in particular the importance of kick-starting investment – the second and fully relevant “i” of the turkish presidency’s agenda. but let’s not just focus on fixed investment in physical productive capacities and infrastructure, but also on investment in human capital. around half of the growth achieved by oecd countries since wwii has been driven by progress in education. priority should therefore be given to reforms aimed at developing skills and knowledge-based capital. raising the quality and inclusiveness of education systems will underpin this. this brings me to the third “i” of the presidency’s agenda – which is absolutely pivotal to our efforts: inclusiveness. the gap between rich and poor is at its highest level in 30 years in most oecd countries while inequalities traditionally stand at even higher levels in emerging countries. this is likely one factor behind weak demand in some countries. more profoundly, oecd recent analysis shows that inequalities are not just about income, but also about opportunities in general, such as access to education and health, with the resulting risk of creating a negative spiral of underinvestment in skills, growing inequality and, down the line, slow growth. according to some oecd estimates, rising inequality may have knocked more than 10 percentage points off growth in mexico, nearly 9 points in the united kingdom, and between 6 and 7 points in the united states and italy between 1990 and 2010. we therefore need a “copernician” change in our approach to the growth – inequality nexus: let’s not think growth first, and inequality thereafter but let’s consider both of them, together, in their circularity. in other words, let’s think “”, right from the start, and let’s make it another touchstone of our efforts and complement the pittsburgh tryptic of strong, sustainable and balanced growth! the oecd is ready to provide our expertise and support to build more productive, inclusive and sustainable economies for your citizens.thank you.

691@Colombia needs a comprehensive tax reform to boost investment and diversify the economy, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/colombia-needs-a-comprehensive-tax-reform-to-boost-investment-and-diversify-the-economy.htm@"19/01/2015 - the colombian economy has done remarkably well over the last decade, consistently ranking among the fastest-growing countries in latin america, but a comprehensive tax reform that promotes investment and diversifies the economy is now needed to put the country on a path toward stronger, sustainable and inclusive growth, according to the latest oecd economic survey of colombia.the oecd identifies a number of policies critical for future growth and reducing the high levels of income inequality. a comprehensive tax reform is needed to make the tax system more investment- friendly, more efficient and fairer, while pension system reform could reduce old-age poverty. boosting infrastructure investment - by fulfilling the government’s road concession programme (4g) - and making sub-national investment more effective are also top priorities, the survey said. the survey, presented in bogota by alvaro pereira, director of country studies in the oecd economics department, mauricio cárdenas santamaría, minister of finance and public credit of colombia, and josé uribe, governor of the colombian central bank, notes that colombia is projected to grow close to 4.5% in the coming years, despite less favourable external conditions.“the colombian economy has shown extraordinary dynamism and strength in recent years. its macroeconomic policies are solid, but the decline in oil and coal prices presents a challenge to sustaining growth,” mr pereira said. “while the 2012 tax reform has had very positive effects on formal job creation, and the tax law approved in december 2014 also represents a step in the right direction, further measures are now needed. a comprehensive tax reform can provide the boost to growth and investment that will diversify the economy, further reduce labour informality and improve the well-being of all colombians.”future tax reform must address colombia’s high tax rates on corporate profits, value-added tax on investment goods and the net wealth tax, all of which combine to penalise investment, the oecd said. the survey recommends gradually lowering the corporate income tax rate while enlarging the base, to ensure that more firms actually pay taxes. strengthening the tax administration and increasing penalties will reduce tax evasion. oecd research shows that a 50% reduction in vat and corporate tax evasion could bring more than cop 15 trillion (usd 8 billion) in additional revenues. this windfall could help finance social and infrastructure investments, as well as part of the implementation costs of any future peace plan.  colombia can also make taxation greener, through introduction of a carbon tax, and fairer, by reducing generous personal income tax exemptions and deductions that benefit mainly wealthy taxpayers, notably as concerns high pensions and dividends, the survey said.the oecd also recommends an in-depth reform of the pension system to reduce old-age poverty and inequality. around two-thirds of the elderly do not currently have any form of pension, while the minimum old-age income support is below the national poverty line.reforms can simultaneously ensure that the elderly have access to a decent pension while maintaining sound public finances. the oecd supports an expansion of eligibility for the beneficios económicos periódicos programme, alongside increased coverage and benefit levels of the minimum income support colombia mayor programme. furthermore, reforms that reduce informality, such as investing in skills and reducing non-wage labour costs, can expand both coverage and funding for social protection programmes.an overview of the economic survey of colombia is available at: www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-colombia.htman embeddable version of the report is available, together with information about downloadable and print versions of the report.the new economic survey of colombia feeds into the country’s ongoing oecd accession process, which was launched in october 2013 in bogota during a visit by the secretary-general, on the basis of the may 2013 decision by the oecd council to open accession discussions with colombia and latvia.colombia is currently working through an accession roadmap, which sets out the terms, conditions and process for its accession to the organization. the accession roadmap calls for a series of in-depth reviews conducted by 23 oecd technical committees, which, in turn, will provide a formal opinion to the oecd council on colombia’s willingness and ability to implement oecd standards and of its policies and practices as compared to oecd best policies and practices in the relevant area.these reviews are seen as an opportunity to support the colombian authorities in pushing forward reforms in line with oecd standards and best practices. there is no set timeline or end date for the accession process, and progress made ultimately depends on the ability of colombia to respond to recommendations made by oecd committees, formed by its members, in order to successfully complete the technical reviews.the 34 member oecd promotes policies that improve the economic and social well-being of people worldwide. the organisation provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems.the oecd's current members are: austria, australia, belgium, canada, chile, czech republic, denmark, estonia,

692@Building on rural sector is key for economic modernisation in Myanmar, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/press-release-mdcr-myanmar-vol2.htm@"14/01/2015 - improving myanmar's agricultural sector by building up food processing activities and related services could help the transformation of the country's economy, to a more modern one able to produce higher-value goods for export, according to a new oecd report.poor rural infrastructure, inadequate farmer skills, insufficient government services to promote exports and lack of access to finance in the agricultural sector would also need to be addressed, the report says. for example, only 2.5% of loans in myanmar go to the rural sector despite the fact the sector accounts for 30% of gross domestic product (gdp) and two-thirds of jobs.""myanmar's transformation to a modern economy could be kick-started through a strong focus on the agricultural sector where most people currently work. increasing access to finance in rural areas and improving farmer skills will be vital to boosting farm productivity, freeing up workers for manufacturing and services"", said oecd deputy secretary general rintaro tamaki, launching volume 2 of the oecd's multi-dimensional review of myanmar in yangon.in the manufacturing sector, the main factors hampering business development are corruption, a lack of technology and poor access to land and office space, according to the report.resolving ambiguity over land rights, improving infrastructure and reforming the financial system would help create the right conditions for the wider economy to flourish. more government support to promote myanmar’s exports abroad and in strengthening health and safety regulatory systems so that products meet export standards would also have a positive impact.this structural transformation will need considerable investment. achieving the government’s growth targets could require investment of between 21% and 28% of gdp annually over the next two decades and as much as 30-40% of gdp by 2035. to meet its funding needs, myanmar should consider all available sources of finance. external sources - including official development aid, foreign direct investment and remittances from the country’s large diaspora - could meet as much as one third of financing needs for the rest of the decade. however, the bulk of financial resources, especially for the medium to long term, will need to come from domestic sources, including government revenues and household savings, which are currently very low.the oecd's multi-dimensional review of myanmar notes the reforms initiated by the government in many areas - including the management of external development finance, the tax structure and the financial system - and stresses the need for continued progress. ""sustaining the momentum of the reform process is essential to ensure that people's incomes and living standards rise"", stated oecd deputy secretary general tamaki.the oecd has been working with the government of myanmar on the multi-dimensional review of myanmar, in partnership with unescap. oecd multi-dimensional country reviews are a new tool for tailoring oecd expertise to the realities of developing economies. to support policymakers, the reviews aim to design policies and strategies which reconcile economic, social and environmental objectives to ensure that countries’ development paths are sustainable and that the lives of citizens improve.further information on the multi-dimensional country review is available at http://www.oecd.org/dev/mdcr.htmrequests for interviews or an electronic copy of the report should be directed to the oecd development centre (dev.media@oecd.org; tel: +33 145 24 82 96)."
693@Challenges and opportunities of India’s manufacturing sector@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js7t9q14m0q-en@productivity of the manufacturing sector is low, partly because the relatively small size of manufacturing firms makes it difficult to exploit economies of scale. despite abundant, low-skilled and relatively cheap labour, indian manufacturing is surprisingly capital and skill intensive. furthermore, firms have little incentive to grow, since by staying small they can avoid taxes and complex labour regulations. land acquisition is slow, companies face frequent power outages and transport infrastructure is below par. this is especially harmful as manufacturing is highly reliant on well-functioning infrastructure.stronger manufacturing would increase productivity and make growth more inclusive, while contributing to improved current account balance. in particular, india should aim for more formal jobs, as these tend to be the most secure and of highest productivity.
694@Improving health outcomes and health care in India@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js7t9ptcr26-en@with india’s low life expectancy largely reflecting deaths from preventable diseases, the most significant gains in health would come from population-wide preventive measures. access to public health care services varies substantially, resulting in many people turning to private-sector providers who mainly serve those who can pay. while government has scaled up public health services, more health professionals and public health care spending will be needed to ensure broad and adequate health-care coverage. priority should be given to high impact primary health care services. for more resources to translate into better services, the management of public health care services needs to improve. the private sector can be drawn upon more extensively, but should also be obliged to meet basic quality standards.
695@Mexico has a unique opportunity to boost growth and share prosperity more widely, according to the OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/mexico-has-a-unique-opportunity-to-boost-growth-and-share-prosperity-more-widely.htm@8/01/2015-mexico now has the chance to dramatically boost growth rates and resume convergence of its living standards towards those of advanced economies, reduce pervasive labour market informality and drive down high rates of poverty and income inequality. the momentous reforms that have now been legislated (in labour, competition, education, energy, the financial sector, infrastructure, telecommunications and the tax system) could have a significant economic impact. however, they will have to be accompanied by decisive actions that improve the functioning of judicial institutions, strengthen the rule of law, address security issues and reduce widespread corruption, the oecd said.if fully implemented, these reforms could boost productivity and investment, increasing annual gdp growth by as much as one percentage point over the next 10 years. reforms that will introduce competition in sectors traditionally dominated by monopolies are likely to have the most impact in the near term, while those to education will have more lasting effects in the years to come.according to the oecd economic survey of mexico 2015, presented in mexico city by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and mexico’s finance minister luis videgaray, moving forward with implementation of the recently approved reforms will require ambitious initiatives to improve public administration, the justice system and security. this could reverse the disappointing economic performance of recent decades.the reforms, along with the global recovery, could generate annual growth of up to 4% in the years ahead. converging towards the best oecd international practices in the areas of justice and informality could increase mexico’s potential growth by one additional percentage point per year. however, there are risks underlying the medium-term macroeconomic and budgetary perspectives, notably those deriving from decreasing oil prices and tightening of us monetary policy. in the short term, mexico is protected by its policy framework and hedging mechanisms. it will nonetheless need to reduce the high dependency on oil revenues and maintain solid public finances. low oil prices should be a catalyst to reduce, once and for all, the mexican economy’s reliance on this primary resource. “mexico has launched an unprecedented effort to break with the past and put the economy on a path of rising income and shared prosperity,” mr gurría said.“this ambitious agenda makes mexico an example to be followed by other countries in need of reform, but full implementation is crucial, and concerted efforts are needed at all levels of government. the fundamental remaining challenge is to ensure that the institutions are robust enough to enforce laws and regulations effectively, uphold the rule of law, reduce corruption and offer sufficient public security to all citizens.”the oecd also provides detailed recommendations to make mexico’s growth more inclusive by reducing inequalities of income and opportunity, fighting poverty and promoting the participation of women in the labour market. these recommendations include further reforms in education, promotion of access to quality healthcare and childcare, new systems of unemployment insurance and universal pensions and the full roll-out of the prospera cash transfer programme.“reducing income inequality would not only improve well-being but also support economic growth,” mr gurría said. “economic growth needs to be shared among the many, rather than concentrated among the few. the reform process has to help reduce inequality, and ensure that every mexican has an equal chance to succeed.”an overview of the economic survey of mexico is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-mexico.htma freely embeddable version of the report is available, together with information about downloadable and print versions of the report.for further information, journalists should contact the oecd media division (+33 1 45 24 97 00).

701@Can pro-growth policies lift all boats? An analysis based on household disposable income@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxrh8dh5wg7-en@in a majority of oecd countries, gdp growth over the past three decades has been associated with growing income disparities. to shed some lights on the potential sources of trade-offs between growth and equity, this paper investigates the long-run impact of structural reforms on gdp per capita and household income distribution. pro-growth reforms can be distinguished according to whether they are found to generate an increase or a reduction in household disposable income inequality. those that contribute to reduce inequality include the reduction in regulatory barriers to competition, trade and fdi, as well as the stepping-up in job search assistance and training programmes. conversely, a tightening of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed is found to lift mean household income but to lower income among poorer households, thus raising inequality. several other reforms have no significant impact on income distribution.
702@Trade patterns in the 2060 world economy@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxrmdk5f86j-en@this paper presents long-term trade scenarios for the world economy up to 2060 based on a modelling approach that combines aggregate growth projections for the world with a detailed computable general equilibrium sectoral trade model. the analysis suggests that over the next 50 years, the geographical centre of trade will continue to shift from oecd to non-oecd regions reflecting faster growth in non-oecd countries. the relative importance of different regions in specific export markets is set to change markedly over the next half century with emerging economies gaining export shares in manufacturing and services. trade liberalisation, including gradual removal of tariffs, regulatory barriers in services and agricultural support, as well as a reduction in transaction costs on goods, could increase global trade and gdp over the next 50 years. specific scenarios of regional liberalisation among a core group of oecd countries or partial multilateral liberalisation could, respectively, raise trade by 4% and 15% and gdp by 0.6% and 2.8% by 2060 relative to the status quo. finally, the model highlights that investment in education has an influence on trade and high-skill specialisation patterns over the coming decades. slower educational upgrading in key emerging economies than expected in the baseline scenario could reduce world exports by 2% by 2060. lower up-skilling in emerging economies would also slow-down the restructuring towards higher value-added activities in these emerging economies.
703@Making economic growth more socially inclusive in Germany@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxrmdjk28kg-en@while past labour market reforms have been successful in terms of employment, the relative poverty risk and income inequality have remained broadly unchanged in recent years. some social groups remain particularly vulnerable, including individuals in non-regular employment, the unemployed and the low skilled. if in employment, their jobs tend to be unstable and wages and income mobility low. continued efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the most vulnerable groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the gaps between the rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. these efforts should include enhancing the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and increase upward income mobility among disadvantaged individuals; strengthening skills at the lower end of the skills distribution; revising the tax and benefit system to improve incentives and to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution; and to make health and old-age pension insurance more inclusive. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of germany (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm).

708@Reforms poised to put India on a strong, sustainable and inclusive growth path, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/reforms-needed-to-keep-india-on-a-strong-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth-path.htm@"19/11/2014 - the indian economy is showing signs of a turnaround. new reforms, some of which are included in the package presented by prime minister narendra modi, need to be implemented to put the country on a path to strong, sustainable and inclusive growth, according to the latest oecd economic survey of india.the survey, presented in new delhi by oecd chief economist catherine l. mann and arvind subramanian, chief economic adviser to the government of india, notes that india slowed more than many other countries since 2011, but is now recovering faster. india’s gdp should grow by more than 6.5 percent annually in the coming years.investment and exports are driving the rebound, but growth will be sustained at a stronger pace if further steps are taken. in the near term, stable and lower inflation and smaller deficits are needed. structural improvements to the business climate are crucial for medium term growth, and in the longer-term, health improvements and increased female participation in the labour market will sustain strong and inclusive growth.“the indian economy is coming out of some tough times in recent years, with a steep decline in growth, stubbornly high inflation and a wide current account deficit, but the situation is now improving,” ms mann said. “key reforms in the business environment, to labor markets and to infrastructure will bring economic growth back to the higher levels seen in the recent past, create good jobs and improve well-being for all indians.”the oecd identifies policies critical for future growth. it says india should formally adopt a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which will help contain inflation expectations and provide support for saving and investment. it also suggests implementing a broad national value-added tax (gst) and cutting energy subsidies, as part of wider efforts to put public finances on a stronger footing. the survey draws attention to the long-term challenges facing india - notably the need to create better-quality jobs for those currently working in the informal sector, as well as to provide employment for the massive influx of young people into the labour force over the coming decades. reducing barriers to manufacturing growth, which has contributed relatively little to growth of gdp or exports, will be critical. the survey discusses the need for a simpler and more flexible labour law, covering more workers, coupled with better education and training programmes.india’s reform agenda should also seek to increase women’s economic participation rates, which are often drastically below those of men. gender-specific policies – including better implementation of gender-related laws on employment and wages - will be necessary to enlarge economic opportunities for women, but the long-term impact could be significant: more and better jobs for women would raise equity and boost growth by over 2 percentage points annually, the oecd said.ensuring better living conditions for all indians – notably access to sanitation – and putting additional public resources into health care would improve health outcomes and contribute to more inclusive growth and well-being, the oecd said.an overview of the economic survey of india is available at: www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-india.htmfor further information, journalists should contact stephen dibiasio (stephen.dibiasio@oecd.org) or the oecd media division (+33 1 45 24 97 00)."

with fiscal and monetary policy room nearly exhausted, structural reforms are the best choices, sometimes the only choice. the oecd battle cry in this regard has been unchanged since 2008: “go structural!”. the good news is that this is mostly what the g20 did this year, thanks to australia’s leadership.the 2% additional growth ambition: a masterstroke! the australian presidency has indeed entirely refocused the agenda of the g20 on the need to reignite growth and strengthen the recovery. it was the first g20 presidency to harness all available sources of growth – macroeconomic and structural policies, taxation, financial regulation, trade, employment, investment, etc. - into holistic growth strategies and to activate the full range of policy levers. this approach went a long way towards bringing the various pieces of the “growth jigsaw” together into a transversal, coherent and effective economic agenda. but the story does not end there: a genuine step-change in the approach was achieved by the presidency with the endorsement by g20 finance ministers of a key measurable objective: to achieve a collective, cumulative 2% additional growth by 2018 over a baseline scenario, as defined in october 2013.“so what?” some of you may object… well, having a specific, well-defined, quantitative growth target over the medium term focused the minds, provided momentum and direction and galvanised members’ efforts. it also enhanced the public visibility of the g20. in other words, it became both the cornerstone of the g20 architecture and the touchstone for its efforts. you all know and talk about the 2% objective and that’s positive because governments will now be held accountable for its achievement. this was in fact, and quite simply, a strategic masterstroke from the australian presidency!but sceptics have a point: what matters, at the end of the day, are the policies and their implementation to reach this target. it is obviously too early to tell regarding implementation. but let me share with you our assessment of the policy commitments encapsulated in the g20 national growth strategies. the oecd, together with the imf, has been asked by the g20 to “unpack” those strategies and their almost 1000 policy commitments: their level of ambition is truly meaningful! all the relevant growth-enhancing policy “ingredients” are there: supporting demand where and when possible; raising productivity by bolstering competition in product and services markets and by investing in skills; facilitating trade and removing obstacles to investment; reforming labour markets and activating employment policies to boost participation and address unemployment.our estimate of their “notional” impact on growth is positive too: according to joint oecd/imf estimates, those efforts, if fully implemented will achieve the 2% objective. g20 work on tax: “the g20 at its best”let me now turn to another key deliverable at the brisbane summit and a central contribution to the resilience of the global economy: the progress achieved in reforming the international tax system. this is not only about revenues; it is about the fairness and efficiency in our societies. taxation lies at the heart of our social contract.everyone understands that fairness and transparency in tax are fundamental for a thriving, trustworthy and inclusive economy. major firms, for instance, should not be able to abuse the blind spots of the global economy to avoid paying taxes by gaming tax legislations and shifting their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. governments will gradually stop these practices, thanks to the oecd/g20 base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project. last september in cairns, the oecd presented g20 finance ministers with the first package of 7 measures agreed under this ambitious project and we expect g20 leaders to endorse them over the week-end. the g20 has also achieved major progress in fighting tax evasion and non-cooperative jurisdictions. also last september, g20 finance ministers endorsed the new single, more ambitious, common global standard for the automatic exchange of information that we developed in less than one year and presented in september. already more than 93 countries, including many developing ones, have committed to implementing the global standard by 2018 at the latest, and 51 countries have already signed to start implementation as early as 2017. these measures are paying off: in five years, some €37 billion have already been collected from “voluntary” disclosure programmes involving just 24 countries. more is expected. by 2008, after 12 years of efforts, the oecd had managed to promote 40 rather dysfunctional agreements for the exchange of tax information. today, there are 3000. the work on tax is definitely a “success story” of the g20 and, as president obama once remarked, “the g20 at its best”. the oecd is proud to have been a major force behind this quantum leap.  inclusive and green growth: the “new frontiers” of the g20we are proud but not complacent. the g20 has still a long way to go: as i said, implementation of the national growth strategies will be of the essence. in some areas, such as trade, progress has been limited, if not disappointing. oecd’s work on global value chains (gvcs), trade in value added (tiva) and on the services restrictiveness index (stri) amounts to the “decoding of the trade genome” and offers endless possibilities, but it needs the collective resolve of the g20. trade today is growing at half the speed necessary to boost growth.also, we must be careful to ensure that g20 growth strategies not only boost growth and jobs, but also address inequalities. today, the average income of the richest 10% of the population in the oecd is almost 10 times that of the poorest 10%, compared to 7 times in the 1980s and 8 times in the 1990s. in the us, it is around 16 times, in mexico over 25, in brazil around 50 times and in south africa around 100 times. and it many countries, it is still growing. and inequality is not only about income but has become truly multi-dimensional: oecd analysis reveals large inequalities in health, education, strength of social connections, political engagement and sense of personal security. some may think that this is not an issue for the g20. it is! if the g20 worries about growth, it should worry about inequalities. work underway at the oecd confirms that high levels of inequality harm economic growth. our analysis shows that, if inequality continues to increase in oecd countries, it could result in 7.5% lower gdp per capita over the next 25 years. the g20 commitment to reduce the gender gap in labour market participation by 25% by 2025 is promising and shows the way. it could add as much as 1.6% to gdp by that date. but more needs to be done in the area of inclusive growth. the same reasoning applies to climate change. we are on a collision course with nature. the latest oecd analysis shows that unabated climate change can dampen future economic growth: world gdp in 2060 could be lowered by 1.5% on average, and in south and southeast asia by nearly 6%, mainly due to losses in agriculture and sea level rises. the g20 cannot say that a systemic issue such as climate change is not in its remit. we need to engage the private sector, mobilise clean investment and advance meaningful outcomes in light of cop 21 in paris at the end of 2015.ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, the australian g20 presidency must be commended not only for setting an ambitious agenda but for also for re-organising the g20 “modus operandi” and instilling a real sense of purpose in its work. we encourage successor presidencies to maintain momentum. but we invite them also to define the win-win policies that combine strong economic growth with improvements in all those aspects of life that matter for people’s wellbeing – good health, jobs and skills, and a clean environment. in today’s uncertain world, the g20 can provide the leadership needed to make the right choices to end the crisis and help design, develop and deliver “better policies for better lives.”thank you.
717@Emerging Asia to see healthy medium-term growth but institutional reforms will be critical for future, says the OECD Development Centre@http://www.oecd.org/economy/saeo2015-press-release.htm@nay pyi taw, myanmar, 13 november 2014 – while the outlook for many oecd countries remains subdued, emerging asia is set for healthy growth over the medium term, according to the latest economic outlook for southeast asia, china and india. annual gdp growth for the asean -10, china and india is forecast to average 6.5% over 2015-19. growth momentum remains robust in the 10 asean countries, with economic growth averaging 5.6% over 2015-19. the region remains exposed to domestic and external risks, however, that make continued reform, regional integration and the strengthening of institutional capacities critical.the outlook sees the large asean-5 economies – indonesia, malaysia, the philippines, thailand and viet nam – sustaining their growth momentum over the medium term, led by indonesia (6.0%) and the philippines (6.2%). economic prospects for brunei darussalam and singapore are stable, while cambodia, lao pdr and myanmar are set to speed ahead with average annual growth exceeding 7%.of emerging asia’s two largest economies, china’s growth is forecast to slow to 6.8% over 2015-19 as it adjusts to changing demographics, a shift from investment- to consumption-led growth and agricultural, environmental and educational challenges. india's growth should remain stable at 6.7%, before any potential boost from the new government’s reform plans.“while the emerging asian economies show resilience, they remain exposed to several risks, including slowing external sources of demand and regional political instability,” said oecd deputy secretary-general rintaro tamaki during the launch of the report at the asean business and investment summit in myanmar. “further accelerating the process of regional integration to build the asean economic community by 2015 is necessary, as is building the domestic capacities in the public sectors to support the implementation of policies that will foster growth and development.”“strengthened institutional capacities and effective governments are needed across the region to foster sustainable and inclusive growth. the outlook highlights the importance of pursuing comprehensive, well-designed and appropriately-paced reforms, while recognising the importance of country-specific contexts in shaping their outcomes” said oecd development centre director mario pezzini.”national medium-term development plan targets identify and express governments' priorities well. performance in turning these targets into results has varied greatly between countries and policy areas within countries.for example, indonesia’s national medium-term development plan (2010-2014) and the philippines’ development plan (2011-2016) contributed to strong economic performances in both countries, but challenges remain in reducing inequalities. strong growth rates fostered by malaysia’s tenth plan (2011-2015) put the country on a favourable path but much still needs to be done to reach inclusiveness and sustainability targets. malaysia will also have to improve its productivity levels to become a high-income country.public sector reforms have made substantial progress in southeast asia, china and india, though many countries in the region need to make further improvements for a better ranking on the government effectiveness index and other measures of public sector performance.similarly, emerging asia has had mixed success in building the institutions on which markets rely – such as the rule of law and contract enforcement – and in enforcing tax and regulatory demands on the private sector. these areas identified of potential weakness need to be addressed to cope with informality, which hampers the real growth potential, and to encourage the expansion of flexible formal markets.for further informtion, please contact:for more information on the preliminary version of the economic outlook for southeast asia, china and india, with country specific policy focuses visit: www.oecd.org/dev/economic-outlook-for-southeast-asia-china-and-india-23101113.htmthe outlook contributes to the oecd southeast asia regional programme, launched at the oecd ministerial council meeting in 2014. the programme aims to foster the exchange of good practices and mutual learning among policy makers in oecd and asean countries.
718@Comprehensive action needed to shift the global economy into higher gear, says OECD in latest Economic Outlook@http://www.oecd.org/economy/comprehensive-action-needed-to-shift-the-global-economy-into-higher-gear.htm@06/11/2014 - the global economy remains stuck in low gear, but is expected to accelerate gradually if countries implement growth-supportive policies. widening differences across countries and regions are adding to the major risks on the horizon, according to the advanced g20 release of the oecd’s latest global economic outlook, june 2017.“we have yet to achieve a broad-based, sustained global expansion, as investment, credit and international trade remain hesitant,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said while launching the outlook in the run-up to the g20 leaders’ summit that will take place on 15-16 november in brisbane. “financial risks remain high and may increase market volatility in the coming period. there is an increasing risk of stagnation in the euro area. countries must employ all monetary, fiscal and structural reform policies at their disposal to address these risks and support growth,” mr gurría said. (read the speech)global gdp growth is projected to reach a 3.3% rate in 2014 before accelerating to 3.7% in 2015 and 3.9% in 2016, according to the outlook. this pace is modest compared with the pre-crisis period and somewhat below the long-term average. it is also slightly lower than the last oecd forecast in september.among the major advanced economies, recovery remains robust in the united states, which is projected to grow by 2.2% in 2014 and around 3% in 2015 and 2016. growth in the euro area is expected to pick up slowly, from 0.8% in 2014 to 1.1% in 2015 and 1.7% in 2016. in japan, growth will continue to be impacted by consumption tax hikes, and is expected to be 0.9% in 2014, 1.1% in 2015 and 0.8% in 2016.large emerging economies are also projected to show diverging performance over the coming years. china is rebalancing its economy while trying to achieve a controlled slowdown to more sustainable growth rates, and is projected to grow at around 7% over the 2015-16 period, down slightly from 7.4% in 2014. growth will strengthen in india as investment picks up, from a 5.4% rate in 2014 to 6.4% in 2015 and 6.6% in 2016.growth in brazil has slumped, with the economy set to expand by only 0.3% in 2014, before a recovery to 1.5% in 2015 and 2% in 2016. the russian economy, hit by lower oil prices and weakening trade, will expand by only 0.7% this year, and growth is expected to fall to zero in 2015 before recovering to 2% in 2016.‌the outlook draws attention to significant downside risks. a major concern is the weakness of demand in the euro area, which points to a rising risk of a prolonged period of stagnation and low inflation. tightening of us monetary policy could lead to financial market volatility for emerging market economies. high levels of debt in some advanced and emerging economies also raise financial stability concerns. moreover, a key risk is that the slowdown in potential output growth since the crisis leads to even weaker trend growth than currently anticipated.the advanced oecd economic outlook - the full report will be presented on 25 november - provides policy recommendations for strengthening growth and combating downside risks. the outlook acknowledges that countries are at different points in the cycle, and consequently policies will diverge.monetary policy still needs to support demand in all the major advanced economies, in the united states, continued growth and tightening labour markets should allow policy rates to begin rising from mid-2015. by contrast, the bank of japan should continue quantitative easing until its inflation target has been sustainably achieved.with euro area inflation far below target and drifting downward, the european central bank should expand its monetary policy stimulus – even beyond measures already announced - building on the positive steps taken to date.with significant progress already made to strengthen the fiscal position of many advanced economies, a considerable easing of the pace of consolidation is warranted in many cases, notably the united states and the euro area. all available room under the eu fiscal rules should be used to avoid negative effects on demand and to allow the automatic stabilisers to work fully. fiscal consolidation should proceed steadily in japan.ambitious structural reforms that complement macroeconomic policies can boost growth in advanced and emerging countries alike. to this end, g20 countries are set to deliver national growth strategies at the brisbane summit that could collectively lift g20 gdp by about 2% by 2018 relative to the 2013 level.“reforms to tax, trade, labour, and product markets will benefit domestic investment and global trade, and support greater employment and consumption around the world,” oecd chief economist catherine mann said. “the potential pay-off from the structural reform agenda under consideration is tremendous, but countries must implement the measures that have been identified to get the global economy into higher gear. macroeconomic policy support must be part of the package.”for more information on the economic outlook, see: www.oecd.org/economy/outlook/economicoutlook.htmjournalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 97 00)
719@Economic activity is accelerating in the Slovak Republic, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-activity-is-accelerating-in-the-slovak-republic.htm@05/11/2014 - economic recovery is picking up in the slovak republic, but regional disparities and high unemployment must be addressed to ensure balances inclusive growth over the long-term, according to the latest oecd economic survey of the slovak republic.the survey, presented in bratislava by oecd secretary-general angel gurríaslovakian prime minister robert fico , underlines the country’s accelerating rebound from the financial crisis, which has been among the strongest in europe. slovakia's gdp is projected to grow by 2.6 percent this year, 2.8 percent in 2015 and 3.4 percent in 2016. the oecd identifies a series of policy reforms that will help the slovak republic reform its public sector and to spur growth in the central and eastern regions. reform and investment in education, where regional disparities of opportunity are prevalent, are key recommendations of both the survey and the new oecd review of evaluation and assessment in education: slovak republic, also presented by mr. gurría to slovakian officials. (read the speech) “the slovak republic has rebounded further from the global financial crisis than most other european countries, but prosperity has not been shared equally,” mr gurría said. “better connectivity and comprehensive reforms are needed to attract economic activity to lagging regions while ensuring bratislava retains its dynamism. public sector reform and investment in education are two keys that can help unlock inclusive growth.”while the economy is becoming more balanced towards private consumption, exports will continue to play an important role in the years to come, and growth could be weaker if the euro area recovery is delayed, the oecd said. low levels of employment and inefficiencies in the public sector could also hold back growth.boosting training and job search assistance programmes, providing financial incentives for the adoption of new technologies and investment in innovation, and improving national road and rail transport infrastructure as well as international connections will help reduce regional disparities.making it easier for people to rent a home would also promote mobility, allowing residents of lagging regions to seek employment in the booming west of the country, the survey said.improving public sector performance will increase slovakia's ability to finance and implement growth-friendly measures while moving ahead on necessary fiscal consolidation plans. the oecd recommends slovakia continue its ongoing programme of ambitious and comprehensive public sector reforms, but suggests more can be done to modernise and increase efficiency across all levels of public administration. this should include actions to establish better human resources management, continue the fight against corruption, improve transparency and the quality of public procurement to ensure the best value for money, and strengthen the budgetary framework, notably by establishing multi-annual expenditures ceilings.the survey also suggests that public sector reform should include further steps to improve the business environment, by easing regulation in the professional services and retail sectors, improving regulatory impact assessment, strengthening the efficiency and independence of the judiciary and making better use of european union funds.» an overview of the economic survey of the slovak republic is available at:www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-slovak-republic.htm» the oecd review of evaluation and assessment in education: slovak republic is available at:www.oecd.org/edu/school/oecd-evaluation-review-slovak-republic.pdffor further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (+33 1 45 24 97 00).
720@A revival of the private rental sector of the housing market? Lessons from Germany, Finland, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxv9f32j0zp-en@a revival of the private rental sector of the housing market? lessons from germany, finland, the czech republic and the netherlandsthis working paper studies ways to stimulate the private rental sector (prs) of the housing market – and compares experiences with policies and reforms in germany, the netherlands, finland and the czech republic. although in many countries the prs has decreased in importance since the second world war, there are signs of a growing importance and possible ‘revival’ of the prs. a well-functioning prs and neutrality in housing policies can improve the functioning of the housing market – by promoting residential mobility, increasing housing options for households and generating competitive supply and affordable prices. the prs can have positive effects on the economy and labour mobility and reduce inefficiencies and risks of owner-occupied and social housing. trade-offs between goals in housing policies, and regulatory impediments to a level playing field between segments of the housing market (owner-occupancy, social rental, private rental) are analysed. the article outlines policy options in promoting a well-functioning prs: lessons are drawn on tenancy security, rent-setting regulations, social housing, demand subsidies, fiscal measures for rental and owner-occupied housing and barriers for prs supply. experiences from the countries show that it is hard to create a level playing field – there are inefficiencies in all four countries. nonetheless, there are many positive experiences of stimulating the prs: reforms in finland and the czech republic stimulated the prs to become a competitive and important part of the housing market, and dutch policies are adapted to stimulate a level playing field. the ‘resilience’ of the german housing system during the economic crisis shows that the large prs and tenure neutrality have important stabilising effects on the german economy.h24: public economics / taxation, subsidies, and revenue / personal income and other nonbusiness taxes and subsidies; r21: urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics / household analysis / urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics: housing demand; r52: urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics / regional government analysis / regional government analysis: land use and other regulations; g21: financial economics / financial institutions and services / banks; depository institutions; micro finance institutions; mortgages; r38: urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics / real estate markets, spatial production analysis, and firm location / production analysis and firm location: government policy; e21: macroeconomics and monetary economics / consumption, saving, production, investment, labor markets, and informal economy / macroeconomics: consumption; saving; wealth; l74: industrial organization / industry studies: primary products and construction / construction; r31: urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics / real estate markets, spatial production analysis, and firm location / housing supply and markets
721@Fundamental reforms paving the way for economic recovery in Portugal, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/fundamental-reforms-paving-the-way-for-economic-recovery-in-portugal-oecd-says.htm@27/10/2014 - fundamental reforms have helped put the portuguese economy back on the right track, but a durable recovery will require additional measures to improve export competitiveness, create jobs and ensure social protection for those most in need, according to the latest oecd economic survey of portugal. the survey, presented in lisbon by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and portugal’s minister of finance maria luís albuquerque, draws attention to the significant steps the country has taken to emerge from the severe recession and successfully exit the external financial assistance programme.according to the survey, portugal’s gdp is projected to grow by 0.8 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2015. it notes that export performance is improving and fiscal consolidation has put public finances on a better footing. unemployment is declining, albeit from high levels.“portugal has made tremendous progress, and its reform efforts are starting to pay off,” mr gurría said. “the main challenge going forward is to build on what has been achieved. this means doing more to enhance productivity and competitiveness, and in turn export performance, while addressing the legacies of the crisis – high unemployment, income inequality, and poverty.” (read the secretary-general's speech)the survey recommends that portugal should continue fiscal consolidation as planned, but that it should allow automatic stabilisers to operate if growth slows. particular attention should be paid to the banking sector, which remains fragile as banks’ balance sheets are still burdened with a high level of non-performing loans. with many firms highly indebted and struggling to pay back loans, authorities should ensure a timely and consistent recognition of banking losses, assess the performance of insolvency procedures, and enhance them when necessary.the crisis, and notably the steep rise in unemployment, reversed a gradual long-term decline in both inequality and poverty, and the number of poor households is now rising, with children and youth particularly affected. while measures to achieve fiscal consolidation efforts have shifted most of the burden to high-income households, the lowest income groups have also suffered significant income losses as a result of these reforms.portugal should strengthen the social safety net by reducing overlaps between different programmes and expanding support for those most in need. policies to facilitate job reinsertion of unemployed people, including by scaling up adult education, should be enhanced.an overview of the economic survey of portugal is available at: www.oecd.org/economy/economic-survey-portugal.htmfor further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (+33 1 45 24 97 00).

725@Secular stagnation: evidence and implications for economic policy@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxvgg6q27vd-en@this paper investigates whether oecd countries are facing secular stagnation. secular stagnation is defined as a situation when policy interest rates bounded at zero fail to stimulate demand sufficiently, due to low or negative neutral real interest rates and low inflation, and when ensuing prolonged and subdued growth undermines potential growth via labour hysteresis and discouraged investment. obtaining firm evidence is complicated by considerable uncertainties surrounding estimates of economic slack and its impact on inflation, crisis-related hit to potential output and neutral interest rates. however, signs of secular stagnation are most evident in the euro area, particularly in the vulnerable members, in contrast to the united states and the united kingdom, where evidence is less firm. japan is arguably in the advanced stage of secular stagnation that started almost two decades ago. in countries with symptoms of secular stagnation, more monetary and fiscal stimulus should be accompanied by structural reforms to boost potential growth and neutral rates. evidence on hysteresis effects strengthens the case for accommodative policies. in general, the large uncertainty about the size and persistence of hysteresis and risks associated with certain measures pose policy dilemmas and call for a comprehensive policy response.
726@Factors behind the decline in real long-term government bond yields@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxvgg7q1322-en@this paper describes developments in real long-term interest rates in the main oecd economies and surveys their various determinants. real long-term government bond yields declined from the 1980s to very low levels in the recent period, though they have not reached the historical lows of the 1970s. the decline in real interest rates has been driven by a combination of factors whose importance has varied over time. in the 1990s, the decline in inflation levels and in volatility was key. in the 2000s, purchases of us government bonds by official investors in emerging market economies, played an important role. more recently, quantitative easing and other unconventional monetary policy action, and possibly the basel-iii-induced increase in bank demand for safe assets, have been main drivers. higher perceptions of risks after the last crisis do not seem to have put lasting downward pressures on government bond yields.
727@Investment gaps after the crisis@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxvgg76vqg1-en@the downturn in fixed investment among advanced economies from the onset of the global crisis was unusually severe, widespread and long-lasting relative to comparable episodes in the past. as a result, investment gaps are large in many countries, not only in relation to past norms but also relative to projected future steady-state levels, with a gap of 2 percentage points of gdp or more in several countries. a significant proportion of this investment shortfall is attributable to soft demand conditions (the accelerator effect) but financial factors and heightened uncertainty have also played a role. in addition to continued support to demand from macroeconomic policies, the recovery in investment could be boosted by tackling longer-term policy issues that bear on investment decisions indirectly, by reducing financial fragmentation in the euro area and by undertaking growth-friendly structural reforms.

734@Addressing high household debt in Korea@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxx0558mfbv-en@rising household debt has become a major policy concern in korea. by the end of 2012, it had risen to 164% of disposable income, well above the oecd average of 133%. in addition to the economic impact and the risk to the financial sector, it raises social cohesion issues, as households with low income and credit ratings have limited access to financial markets and many are delinquent on their loans. it is essential to induce the soft-landing of household debt through a two-track approach: i) offering credit to households with low income and credit ratings and restructuring their debt, while limiting moral hazard and developing market-based lending; and ii) containing the risk caused by high household debt by strengthening prudential measures for financial institutions and improving mortgage lending by reducing the share of floating-rate and “bullet repayment” loans. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of korea (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-korea.htm)

736@Fostering inclusive growth in Turkey by promoting structural change in the business sector@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxx0554v07c-en@turkey’s business sector dynamism has underpinned broad-based and inclusive growth in the 2000s. however, the business sector is highly segmented, with a relatively small core of modern high-productivity corporations, and myriad small, less formal and low-productivity entities. this hampers efficient resource allocation and tends to entrench social inequalities. it also makes it difficult to build on-the-job human capital for the large number of low-skilled. this segmentation needs to be overcome to raise productivity in the informal, low-skill and low-productivity sector, and to facilitate resource transfers from low to higher productivity businesses. this ought to be achieved by aligning turkey’s formal regulatory and tax framework with oecd best practice, rather than through “second-best” arrangements where noncompliance with rules co-exists with selective subsidies to parts of the formal sector. labour market and business taxation reforms are particularly important to enable all categories of enterprises to operate flexibly on a rule-based, level playing field and to achieve productivity enhancing and socially inclusive restructuring.
737@Promoting the financing of SMEs and start-ups in Korea@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxx054bdlvh-en@the korean government has made fostering a “creative economy” a top priority. the goal is to shift korea's economic paradigm to one based on innovation in which new start-ups and venture businesses play a key role. however, the venture capital market is still at an early stage of development. to make venture investment a growth driver, it is important to expand the role of business angels, activate the merger-andacquisition market and foster entrepreneurship. a creative economy also depends on making smes, which account for 87% of employment, more dynamic. the productivity gap between large firms and smes, which benefit from a wide range of public support, is widening. sme policies should be streamlined and improved to promote market-based financing and reduce the negative effects of government funding programmes, which discourage the expansion of smes.
738@Reducing macroeconomic imbalances in Turkey@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxx055pjf0x-en@turkey recovered swiftly from the global financial crisis but sizeable macroeconomic imbalances arose in the process. high consumer price inflation and a wide current account deficit are sources of vulnerability. even though below-potential growth helps rebalancing and disinflation, these imbalances endure. the financial sector still looks resilient thanks to buffers built up mainly prior to the financial crisis. however, private sector balance sheet risks have gained prominence as leverage increased. macroeconomic and structural policy levers need to steer a passage between robust but externally unsustainable growth and externally viable but low growth. monetary policy needs to bring inflation and inflation expectations closer to target. macroprudential policies could more systematically lean against capital inflows and credit cycles to reduce private sector balance sheet vulnerabilities. the fiscal stance is broadly appropriate, but compliance with a multi-year general government spending ceiling would help avoid pro-cyclical loosening in case of revenue surprises and help boost domestic saving. overall, policies should help reduce the risk of disruptions in capital flows as monetary policy stimulus is being withdrawn in the united states.

744@Making the banking sector more resilient and reducing household debt in the Netherlands@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxz9z0fhcwj-en@dutch banks were put under heavy strains early in the global downturn and have comparatively weak financial buffers to cope with new shocks. falling house prices have increased the share of households with negative home equity to nearly 35% for home-owning households and 40% for mortgage holders. even though defaults have so far been limited, mortgage amortisation is low and risks are concentrated among younger borrowers who often do not have sufficient resources to cope with adverse shocks. banks are very large relative to the size of the domestic economy, have sizeable cross-border exposures and rely significantly on wholesale funding. resolution procedures should be strengthened to reduce the potential cost for the taxpayer and the regulator’s tools available to reduce risks should be expanded. in particular, banks should set aside sufficient provisions for expected losses and problem loans, which requires some harmonisation of the definition of non-performing loans across banks. higher capital buffers would bolster financial stability and help ensure access to market funding while lowering its cost. welcome measures have been taken to encourage household deleveraging, but deeper and broader steps are needed to bolster financial stability and improve consumer protection when the housing market starts to recover durably and over the medium term. the stock of existing mortgages should be gradually converted into amortising mortgages, the cap on the loanto- value ratio reduced significantly below 100% and housing subsidies to homeownership cut more decisively. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of the netherlands (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-netherlands.htm).

747@US long term interest rates and capital flows to emerging economies@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz0wh67l733-en@following chairman ben bernanke’s comments before congress that the fomc may ‘take a step down in the pace of asset purchases if economic improvement appears to be sustained’, us 10-year interest rates picked up sharply and gross capital flows to emerging market economies (emes) reversed. these events raised concerns that further increases in us interest rates could trigger sharp changes of capital flows that would be followed by financial crises in emes. to assess this possibility, this paper studies the association between us long term interest rates and cycles of capital flows to emes. it finds that, indeed, cycles in capital flows to emes are linked to global conditions, including global risk aversion and long term interest rates in the united states. in particular, higher us long term interest rates are associated with lower levels of gross capital flows to emes, and to a higher probability of observing sharp reversals in those flows. episodes of net capital inflows, on the other hand, are mostly associated with domestic macroeconomic conditions. in particular, economies with relatively low levels of gross outflows, with a high ratio of short-term debt to international reserves or with weak domestic fundamentals are more vulnerable to the risk of a classic sudden stop à la calvo. this working paper relates to the oecd economic survey of the united states 2014 (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-unitedstates. htm)
748@Productivity measurement with natural capital and bad outputs@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz0wh5t0ztd-en@this paper presents a productivity growth measure that explicitly accounts for natural capital as an input factor and for undesirable goods, or “bads”, as an output of the production process. the discussion focuses on the extension of productivity measurement for bad outputs and estimates of their shadow prices, while the inclusion of natural capital is discussed in more depth in a companion paper. as bad outputs are the target of environmental policies, a productivity measure that does not take bad outputs into account will underestimate productivity growth, whenever countries devote some inputs to reducing bad outputs, thus improving the environmental impact of their production processes, rather than to increasing the production of goods and services. an adjusted productivity measures is needed in an analysis of the effect of bad outputs on productivity growth as otherwise the effectiveness of environmental policies in promoting production processes that make more efficient use of the environment will be wrongly assessed. results suggest that the adjustment of the traditional productivity growth measure for bad outputs is small. while this partly hinges on the fact, that due to a lack of more comprehensive data, only a limited set of bad outputs are considered in this paper, namely co2, sox and nox emissions, the relatively small adjustment of the traditional productivity growth measure is good news for two reasons. first, it implies that ignoring the bad outputs considered in this paper results in a relatively small bias of productivity measurement, and thus analysis based on traditional measures should be relatively reliable in this regard. second, it also implies that the acceleration in productivity growth that would help to substantially reduce the bad outputs considered in this paper, without reducing output growth, should be possible to achieve.
749@Reducing income inequality and poverty and promoting social mobility in Korea@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz0wh6l5p7l-en@to strengthen social cohesion, a top government priority, it is essential to address the labour market roots of inequality by breaking down dualism to reduce the share of non-regular workers and to boost the employment ratio toward the government’s 70% target. education reforms are also important to enhance social mobility. social welfare programmes should be improved to make them more effective, especially among the elderly, where the relative poverty rate is 49%. in addition, reforms are needed now to develop an effective three-pillar system of retirement income based on the national pension scheme, company pensions and individual savings. high household debt also has adverse implications for equity, as well as for growth, as individuals with low income and credit ratings have limited access to financial markets and many are delinquent on their loans. policies to offer credit to such households and restructure their debt, while limiting moral hazard and developing market-based lending, are essential. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of korea (www.oecd.org/eco/economic-survey-korea.htm).

752@Health, work and working conditions: a review of the European economic literature@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz0zb71xhmr-en@economists have traditionally been very cautious when studying the interaction between employment and health because of the two-way causal relationship between these two variables: health status influences the probability of being employed and, at the same time, working affects the health status. because these two variables are determined simultaneously, researchers control endogeneity bias (e.g., reverse causality, omitted variables) when conducting empirical analysis. with these caveats in mind, the literature finds that a favourable work environment and high job security lead to better health conditions. being employed with appropriate working conditions plays a protective role on physical health and psychiatric disorders. by contrast, non-employment and retirement are generally worse for mental health than employment, and overemployment has a negative effect on health. these findings stress the importance of employment and of adequate working conditions for the health of workers. in this context, it is a concern that a significant proportion of european workers (29%) would like to work fewer hours because unwanted long hours are likely to signal a poor level of job satisfaction and inadequate working conditions, with detrimental effects on health. thus, in europe, labour-market policy has increasingly paid attention to job sustainability and job satisfaction. the literature clearly invites employers to take better account of the worker preferences when setting the number of hours worked. overall, a specific “flexicurity” (combination of high employment protection, job satisfaction and active labour-market policies) is likely to have a positive effect on health. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of the united states (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/united states ).

754@Deconstructing Canada’s housing markets: finance, affordability and urban sprawl@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz0zbg20h34-en@house prices have increased significantly in canada over the past decade, driving household debt and residential construction activity to historical highs. although macro-prudential tightening has slowed the pace of household borrowing in the last few years, house prices have continued to trend higher, and affordability remains a major challenge in urban centres. first-time home buyers must therefore spend more of their incomes to purchase a house and are vulnerable to future interest rate hikes. overbuilding in the condominium sectors of some cities appears to be a source of risk, especially if a major price correction in these segments spills over into other markets. the country benefits from a sound and effective housing finance system, which performed well throughout the global financial crisis thanks to strong regulatory oversight and explicit government backing of the mortgage market. nonetheless, the dominance of the crown corporation cmhc in the mortgage insurance market concentrates a significant amount of risk in public finances. improving competitive conditions in the mortgage insurance market could help diversify these risks and reduce taxpayer contingent liabilities, while introducing coverage limits on loan losses would better align private and social interests. there may be a shortage of rental housing in several cities, especially in the range that low-income households can afford. urban planning policies have resulted in low-density residential development which contributes to relatively high transport-related carbon emissions. addressing these externalities requires stronger pricing signals for land development, road use, congestion and parking, combined with better integration of public transit planning. to prevent the marginalisation of low-income households, planning policies should support social mix and increase incentives for private-sector development of affordable housing. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic review of canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/canada).

country"@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz123h8nd7l-en@international migration: the relationship with economic and policy factors in the home and destination countryunfavourable demographic trends in many oecd countries threaten the sustainability of potential labour resources, gdp growth and fiscal positions. one factor that is expected to mitigate these trends is continued inflows of migrant workers from low income economies. however, a rapid catch-up in productivity and wages in these traditional source countries vis-à-vis the oecd may weaken economic incentives for migration and imply a transition away from current migration patterns. this paper uses data of the high-skilled and low-skilled migrant stock between 92 origin and 44 destination countries to highlight the relationship between economic factors and migration. the paper also attempts to uncover links with policy and demographic factors prevailing in the origin and destination countries. the analysis suggests that higher skill-specific wages in the destination country are associated with more migration. this relationship appears to be particularly strong for migrants from middle-income countries, supporting theories of an inverted-u relationship between origin country economic development and the propensity to migrate. policy differences between the destination and origin also appear important, for example in terms of regulations on businesses and labour markets, along with the relative quality of institutions. in some instances, the effects on high-skilled and low-skilled migrants differ markedly. combining the estimated coefficients from the model with the skill-specific wage profile from the oecd long-term growth projections highlights the potential for weaker future migrant flows to oecd countries than implied by past trends and embedded in official projections.f22: international economics / international factor movements and international business / international migration; j01: labor and demographic economics / general / labor economics: general; o15: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth / economic development / economic development: human resources; human development; income distribution; migration
760@Gross earning inequalities in OECD countries and major non-member economies: determinants and future scenarios@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz123k7s8bv-en@income and earning inequality has been on the rise in most of the oecd and in many emerging economies since the 1980s. this paper estimates a model of earnings inequality across oecd countries that incorporates determinants of relative demand and supply of more and less-skilled labour. drawing on oecd data we find that skill-biased technological change – measured as a common cross-country time trend and the level of multi factor productivity – has been the key driver in increasing earning differentials. the analysis also shows that educational attainment has mitigated the impact of skill-biased technological change on earning differentials, but has in most countries been unable to fully compensate. in line with previous oecd analysis, changes in structural policies and labour market institutions, such as deregulation of product and labour markets have exerted upward pressure on inequality. the estimated model is used to decompose historical changes in earning differentials and to construct forward looking scenarios up to 2060. if the common cross-country trend of skill-biased technological change observed during the last 25 years prevails, earning differentials will on average increase by almost 30% in the oecd by 2060. finally, the model is used to simulate the consequences of alternative policy scenarios over the coming 50 years.
761@Women’s role in the Swiss economy@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz123dzstkb-en@swiss women are now as well educated as their male counterparts. however, progress remains to be made in the job market where both the supply and price of female labour are below that of men. while the participation rate for women is high and rising, it is offset by a heavy incidence of part-time work, reflecting both personal preferences and factors that limit their labour supply. the lack and high cost of childcare options for parents, as well as burdensome marginal income tax rates for second earners, create disincentives to work more. a falling but persistent net (i.e. unexplained) wage gap of about 7% in favour of men, coupled with under-representation of women as managers and entrepreneurs, further reduce the incentive for women to take full advantage of their high levels of human capital. priority should be given to removing those barriers by increasing public spending on childcare and out-of-school-hours care at the cantonal and municipal levels. existing regulations regarding childcare provision should also be investigated to see whether a broader range of price and quality childcare options is feasible. the implicit tax penalty for married women should also be removed, as the federal council is currently considering. more flexibility in working arrangements could further alleviate women’s cost of reconciling work and family life. for instance, facilitating flexi-time, annualised hours, job-sharing, part-time and telework options for both women and men, and creating paternity and/or consecutive, take-it-or-leave-it parental leave could facilitate transition in and out of the labour market. increasing competition in product markets should help reduce the wage gap by replacing old habits with the hunt for talent regardless of gender. finally, a corporate governance code in favour of a more equal representation of women in leadership positions, and setting ambitious quantitative targets for women on boards combined with the “comply or explain” practise, or quotas, should help remove the so-called glass ceiling. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic review of switzerland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/switzerland).

Cross-country evidence from firm level data@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2lpmk0gs6-en@this paper exploits longitudinal data on firm performance and patenting activity for 23 oecd countries over the period 2003-2010 to explore the extent to which changes in the patent stock are associated with flows of capital and labour to patenting firms. while the finding that patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level is in line with recent literature, new empirical evidence presented suggests that the impact of patenting on firm size is likely to be causal. moreover, these data reveal important differences across oecd countries in the extent to which innovative firms can attract the complementary tangible resources that are required to implement and commercialise new ideas. in turn, the contribution of framework policies to explaining the observed cross-country differences in the magnitude of these flows is explored. while further research is required to establish causality, the results are consistent with the idea that well-functioning product, labour and capital markets; efficient judicial systems and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure can raise the returns to innovative activity. the paper also investigates the heterogeneous impacts of policies and finds that young firms – which are more likely to experiment with disruptive technologies and rely on external financing to implement and commercialise their ideas – disproportionately benefit from reforms to labour markets and more developed markets for credit and seed and early stage finance.
777@Korea: Implement reforms to develop a creative economy, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/korea-implement-reforms-to-develop-a-creative-economy.htm@17/06/2014 - korea needs to move away from its current economic model and implement a range of reforms to develop a creative economy that can sustain long-term growth, according to the latest oecd economic survey of korea. the strategy should be accompanied by new measures to reduce income inequality and poverty, particularly among the elderly, the oecd said.the survey notes that korea’s short-term economic outlook is positive, with growth of around 4% projected over the 2014-15 period. its longer-term prospects, however, are limited by persistent structural problems, such as a lagging service sector and weak small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), reflecting the traditional growth strategy centred on exports by large chaebol companies. the oecd argues that korea must promote innovation and narrow the productivity gaps between manufacturing and services and between large firms and smes, which account for 87% of total employment.to make smes more efficient, the oecd recommends scaling back and streamlining government support to these firms, while concentrating it on enterprises at an early stage of development. creation of a more dynamic venture capital sector is a second key priority for development of a creative economy, which should also aim to promote green growth and help korea meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction target.the survey points out the importance of increasing returns on r&d investment, which is the largest in the oecd area as a share of gdp. this requires reforms across the entire innovation system to expand the role of universities, upgrade government research institutes and strengthen international linkages. reducing product market regulations and barriers to foreign direct investment is also key for boosting the adoption of new technology.to promote inclusive growth, korea should take steps to reverse the decline in the middle class and reduce the high rate of relative poverty. this will require action aimed at the roots of inequality, notably reducing the high share of non-regular workers in the workforce. breaking down labour market dualism is necessary to reduce high levels of wage inequality and enhance social mobility.high household debt has adverse implications for equity, as well as for growth, as individuals with low income and credit ratings have limited access to financial markets and many are delinquent on their loans. policies to expand market-based lending to such households and debt restructuring are essential, but moral hazard must be limited, the survey said.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (+33 1 4524 9700).

781@Strengthening competition in Poland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2pwzpzvkg-en@poland’s productivity has grown strongly over the past decade, and efforts to reduce the regulatory burden have been significant. despite impressive progress, product market regulation remains more burdensome than in most oecd countries, partly due to the importance of red tape and the level of state involvement in the economy. further reduction in red tape and pursuing privatisation in competitive markets would increase competitive pressures and ensure neutrality, notably in public procurement processes. economic rents in many sectors seem high, as stringent entry regulations, regulatory barriers and inefficient bankruptcy procedures induce significant resource misallocation. a welcome deregulation of professional services is ongoing, and the government plans to further ease firm registrations and reform bankruptcy procedures. the independence of the sector regulators in network industries and the powers of the competition authority can still be enhanced, as the reform efforts in these sectors remain patchy. the dominant positions of the incumbents and the failure of network sector regulators to introduce a level playing field in order to secure third-party access to the sectoral infrastructure and allow new entry in the competitive segments are another main issue. the advantages of being considered a farmer are also slowing the consolidation process in the agricultural sector. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of poland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-poland.htm).
782@Making the labour market work better in Poland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2pwf4wd41-en@poor labour-market outcomes remain one of poland’s major structural weaknesses, impeding firms’ competitiveness and the nation’s potential output. boosting employment prospects is also critical, as the country will soon be ageing at a fast pace. despite long working hours, labour utilisation is only average due to structurally low employment rates, particularly at both ends of the age spectrum, with some marked regional differences. the female employment rate is especially low, in part due to poorly designed family and pension policies. insufficient product-market competition and obstacles to internal mobility induce significant resource misallocation. employment protection is not particularly stringent, but the labour market is nonetheless heavily segmented. this is likely to weigh on economic performance by limiting investment in human capital and making some specific groups bear a large share of adjustment costs. public employment services suffer from a lack of resources and function inefficiently. local labour offices have limited incentives to adopt best practices; the government plans to start benchmarking them. there is ample scope to tighten jobseeker obligations and reform social and tax policies to make work pay. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of poland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-poland.htm).
783@Enhancing competition and the business environment in Hungary@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2pwfr0nzq-en@steps should be taken both at the economy-wide level and in specific sectors to increase investment and restore productivity growth. such measures must include fostering greater regulatory stability, inter alia by reducing the flow of new regulation and improving its quality, not least in taxation. investor confidence would benefit from promoting trust and transparency in public institutions. apart from vigorous competition enforcement across the economy, it is essential to remove sector-specific obstacles to competition, such as barriers to entry of different types, lock-in effects and distortive regulated prices, in retail, professional services, energy, and telecommunications. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of hungary (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-hungary.htm).
784@Tackling labour mismatches and promoting mobility in Hungary@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2px6jtpmt-en@significant labour market mismatches and insufficient mobility penalise employment and productivity. mismatches have above all a skills dimension, with an excess of low-skilled workers and a possible lack of skilled workers in certain domains. reducing the high tax wedge on low salaries and avoiding excessive minimum wage increases would support demand for low-skilled labour. in the longer term, upgrading the labour supply requires improving educational outcomes, especially of disadvantaged students, and making the school-to-work transition less abrupt. to facilitate good matching and enhance sectoral mobility, a somewhat longer duration of unemployment benefits and an upscaled public employment service would be of value, as well as greater focus on reintegration in the public works programme and more efficient and developed lifelong learning. besides skills mismatches, important geographic mismatches are illustrated by high and persistent regional disparities in the unemployment rate. mobility is hampered by the underdevelopment of the rental housing market, while there is room to enhance the efficiency of public transport to further support commuting.
785@Local public finances and municipal reform in Finland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2qt0zj024-en@finnish municipalities enjoy ample fiscal autonomy and provide or arrange the provision of a large share of public services. in recent years, their spending and debt has been increasing steadily, especially because of population ageing and increases in the cost of health care and social services. furthermore, small municipalities are often struggling to align service provision with national standards. the government has launched a reform to create more efficient municipalities through voluntary mergers. both international experience and costs per capita across finnish municipalities suggest an optimal size for municipalities of over 20 000 inhabitants, at least outside remote areas. as mergers are to be voluntary, the outcome of the reform remains uncertain. if merger plans prove insufficient to achieve efficient public service provision, the government could impose mergers on smaller municipalities, especially around the main urban areas. responsibilities of smaller municipalities could be scaled back in all functions where economies of scale and scope can be achieved. policies also need to be flexible enough to allow restructuring of services after mergers. partnerships between public or private entities to provide services could be developed further in some areas. finally, the tax structure and fiscal rules should be enhanced to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of finland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economicsurvey- finland.htm).
786@The economic consequences of ageing: the case of Finland@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2qt1dtnlt-en@finland’s population is set to age rapidly in the coming decades. this will put pressure on public finances, while shrinking labour resources. nonetheless, solutions exist to alleviate those pressures. adjusting the pension age in line with the rise in life expectancy would reduce pension costs and increase older workers’ employment, provided it is accompanied by the removal of the pathways to early retirement. in order to allow people to work longer, labour market flexibility should be enhanced and lifelong training promoted further. active labour market policies should be strengthened so as to increase the labour force participation of youth, childbearing age women and the long-term unemployed. finally, ageing should not only be seen as a burden as it can also create opportunities for innovation and new markets and industries. information and communications technologies, where finland has a strong knowledge base, can help the elderly stay as autonomous as possible, which would contain long-term care costs and improve well-being. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of finland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economicsurvey- finland.htm).
787@Making the most of skills in Denmark@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2qt4crff8-en@surveys suggest that denmark ranks close to or slightly above the oecd average in terms of student and adult skills, even though denmark spends more than many oecd countries on education, labour market policies and adult learning. sluggish productivity growth over the past two decades raises the question of how to develop better skills and use them more efficiently to achieve stronger and more inclusive growth. improving the performance of compulsory and tertiary education would help all students acquire the right skills. ensuring adults upgrade their skills is another key challenge, which involves strengthening the adult learning system. reforms of taxation and of the wage setting system in the public sector would promote a better allocation of skills economy-wide. finally, to activate skills more broadly, reforms to raise labour market participation should continue and the efficiency of active labour market policies will have to be increased further. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of denmark (www.oecd.org/economic-surveydenmark. htm).

789@Policies for making the Chilean labour market more inclusive@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2r9j3f0r6-en@economic growth and recent policy reforms have increased employment and reduced overall poverty in chile. yet there are some groups that remain at the margins of the labour market and could benefit from and contribute more to growth. women and young people have entered the labour force in greater numbers, but their participation rates remain low compared to most oecd and latin american countries. the participation of women in the labour market is held down by economic, cultural and regulatory barriers. for youth, poor basic skills acquired through compulsory education and the weak linkages between secondary education and job related skills often limit their employment prospects. among lowskilled workers, a high minimum wage and strict employment protection pose a barrier to employment. at the same time, education and training policies do not sufficiently reach those with poor skills and the public employment services lack the capacity to deliver high quality job-search services. the paper discusses a number of policies that could help to make the chilean labour market more inclusive and broaden the benefits of growth. these include expanding childcare, promoting a more flexible labour market and strengthening education and skills policies, among others. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of chile (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-chile.htm).
790@Spillover effects from exiting highly expansionary monetary policies@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz417mb6dzp-en@the prospective normalisation of monetary policies in the main oecd areas will be challenging given that current policy rates are likely to be significantly below neutral levels and that central bank balance sheets will be above the pre-crisis levels by a wide margin. monetary policy normalisation is likely to start in the united states before other main oecd areas, with potential global spillovers, as was already experienced in mid-2013 when the mere discussion of tapering unsettled global financial markets. a gradual increase in interest rates, in the context of strong growth and rising equity values, would contribute to a balanced us recovery and have a benign impact on the rest of the world. however, a rapid rise in bond yields would risk generating instability in the us shadow banking sector, and the financial system more generally, even if banks seem increasingly resilient to such a shock. although model simulations suggest that a large and protracted government bond yield shock would not have large trade spillovers in the absence of crisis events in the united states or abroad, an induced increase in bond yields in other countries, together with an induced large decline in equity prices, would have a sizeable effect on the oecd and largest emerging market economies. the latter countries are particularly vulnerable to such spillovers given their generally less liquid financial markets and, in some cases, weak fundamentals related to the banking system and external financing. in the united states, the authorities should aim at managing smoothly the exit and at strengthening the resilience of shadow banking institutions so that the risk of liquidity-induced fire sales is reduced. this should be accompanied in other countries by measures to increase the resilience to interest rate shocks, and when the shock occurs, allowing exchange rates to adjust flexibly and implementing offsetting fiscal measures if scope is available.

germany’s current economic success offers a good platform for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth, but further reforms will be necessary over the medium and long term, according to the latest oecd economic survey of germany. among the priorities are making the tax system more socially just and environment-friendly, strengthening the financial sector, so that it is better able to absorb future risks, increasing the contribution of the service sector and creating greater equality of opportunity in the education system and in the labour market.“our experience has shown that reforms are usually enacted in times of crisis, as there may be no other option,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría during the survey launch in berlin. “however, reform processes should continue in good times. for germany, this means that the country should act now to embark on a more inclusive and resilient growth path.” (read the full speech) reforms over the past decade have enabled germany to boost job creation and drive unemployment to one of the lowest rates in the oecd area. problems are posed, however, by the rapid growth of the low-wage sector and the large number of temporary workers. the sharp drop in unemployment has not reduced inequality or the risk of poverty. upward mobility of low earners has in fact fallen in recent years. ‌13 may 2014 - angel gurría, secretary-general of the oecd presented, together with vice chancellor sigmar gabriel, the 2014 oecd economic survey of germany.the oecd says germany should take steps to heal the split in the labour market between employees with permanent contracts, better protection against dismissal and, in many cases, better salaries, and those with temporary contracts, little protection and lower pay. a universal minimum wage set by an independent commission, including experts and social partners, could aid that effort, as could harmonisation of the rules governing employment protection for employees with temporary and permanent contracts. the survey calls on germany to combat long-term unemployment, which is still fairly widespread, through targeted hiring subsidies and incentives to obtain educational qualifications.also important, according to the survey, is ensuring that young people have equally good starting conditions for education and careers. the currently strong linkage between social background and pupils’ school performance and prospects must be severed. besides investment in early childhood education, the survey calls for more resources for schools with high percentages of socially disadvantaged pupils. it also points out that disproportionately high numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds are taught in schools for students with learning difficulties or disabilities, which often restricts their chances of obtaining a good job.new, higher-quality jobs and better access to the labour market are not only needed to ensure fairness, but are also an economic necessity given ageing of the german population and projected impacts on growth potential and long-term gdp. a slow-growth future will make it harder for germany to fund public services, notably health care, which are likely to be in greater demand in the future.the survey points out scope to lower taxes on labour and reduce welfare contributions, particularly for low earners, as part of efforts to increase growth potential. to offset revenue reductions, taxes on real estate could be increased, on the basis of updated valuations, while tax exemption for profits from the sale of non-owner-occupied properties could be abolished.additional scope for growth-enhancing policies could be created by reducing fiscal support for activities that damage the environment (such as tax breaks for company cars and commuting allowances). the tax system could be used to encourage environment-friendly behaviour, by introducing lower road taxes for energy-efficient cars or extending emission-based tolls to light utility vehicles, or even passenger cars.reforms in the service sector may also help foster growth. the sector already makes the biggest contribution to the creation of wealth in the german economy. by contrast with manufacturing, productivity in business services has seen relatively little increase over the past ten years. accordingly, the survey suggests that the regulation of network industries, independent professions and some manual trades should be further relaxed, to stimulate competition. potential growth-enhancing measures in this sector ranges from ensuring a level playing field for providers of rail services and a more freely accessible infrastructure for mobile communications (wider rights to issue sim cards) to the abolition of statutory fee scales for certain professions, such as notaries.for growth stimuli to have lasting effect, the entire economy must be made more resilient to shocks from the financial sector. with the largest banks heavily leveraged, the paramount task of regulatory authorities should be to ensure that financial institutions possess adequate equity. in the case of large international banks, their leverage ratios should also be kept under surveillance.the oecd points out the need to establish recovery and resolution methods to ensure that the losses of insolvent banks are offset as fully as possible against their liabilities (bail-in). this should be done in line with the framework of a new eu directive to be transposed by 2016. the law should clarify that financial stability objectives take precedence over creditors’ rights in the event of a resolution.an overview of the economic survey of germany is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm. for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (news.contact@oecd.org; tel +33 1 4524 9700)."

796@Make growth socially inclusive for improved well-being and stronger economies – OECD report@http://www.oecd.org/economy/make-growth-socially-inclusive-for-improved-well-being-and-stronger-economies.htm@"05/05/2014 - inequality – now at its highest level in decades in many countries – undermines economic growth and well-being, says a new oecd report.but policies to tackle the widening gap between rich and poor will only succeed if they also look beyond income and address better access to high-quality education, health care and public infrastructure, it adds.the wealthy have overwhelmingly captured the benefits of growth. the average income of the richest 10 percent of the population in oecd countries was nine and a half times higher than that of the poorest 10 percent in 2010, compared with a level seven times higher 25 years ago. in the united states, the richest 1 percent took 47 percent of total income growth between 1976 and 2007, compared with 37 percent in canada and around 20 percent in australia and britain. the gap between rich and poor has widened even faster since the financial crisis. the report reveals the links between income, education and health. data from 14 oecd countries show that at the age of 30, people with the highest education levels could expect to live on average 6 years longer than their poorly educated peers.“all on board: making inclusive growth happen” provides evidence of the consequences of inequality, sets out a framework for action and allows governments to assess how policies impact different social groups in different ways.the report is part of an organisation-wide effort to develop an inclusive agenda for growth and well-being, and is a natural offshoot of the oecd new approaches to economic challenges (naec) project to reflect on the causes of the crisis and the lessons for policy. the inclusive growth initiative pioneers a multi-dimensional framework that explores new ways of combining strong growth with a better distribution of benefits and outcomes.“inequality undermines societies and damages economies,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “it is not enough to put in place policies that harness growth, we must also ensure that the benefits of growth are shared by everyone. this is one of the most pressing challenges we face today.”xavier de souza briggs, vice president of economic opportunity and assets at the ford foundation, a central partner of the oecd’s work on inclusive growth, said: “this important new research adds to a growing body of evidence that economic inclusion is strongly associated with longer and stronger periods of growth. put simply, reducing inequality is not only a moral imperative, it’s an economic one.”the report says economic and social policies should be designed to foster both equity and growth. investing in skills and education, for example, can have far-reaching impact on these twin objectives.local government has a key role to play, particularly by investing in quality housing, public transport and in providing training for disadvantaged groups.the report acknowledges that sound structural policies are a precondition for sustained growth, employment and poverty alleviation, but that there are trade-offs. for instance, reducing regulatory barriers to domestic and foreign competition as well as stepping-up job search support and labour market activation programmes can lift the incomes of the lower middle class faster than the overall rise in gdp per capita through the positive effect on employment. however, a tightening of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed reduces disposable incomes at the bottom end of the distribution, an indication of the importance of combining reforms of unemployment income support with a strengthening of active labour market policies.the report argues that promoting inclusive growth can also help restore citizens’ trust in governments. today, fewer than one in two people in oecd countries have confidence in their nation’s political leadership.• follow the oecd forum session on inclusive growth, including a live webcast (monday 5 may, 10.15 - 12.00)• for further information about the report or the oecd’s work on inclusive growth, journalists should contact the oecd’s media division (tel : + 331 4524 9700 ; news.contact@oecd.org), or visit http://www.oecd.org/inclusive-growth/."
797@Growth and inequality: A close relationship?@http://www.oecd.org/economy/growth-and-inequality-close-relationship.htm@"inequality has risen in the oecd area. could policies aimed solely at growth be responsible? can inequality undermine economic growth? new evidence suggests there is a possibility. income inequality has widened in most oecd member countries during the past two or three decades. these trends are well documented (see references). according to a traditional measure of inequality, the gini coefficient, income inequality rose by 10% from the mid-1980s to the late 2000s, while the ratio of top income decile to bottom income decile reached its highest level in 30 years. however, between countries the rise in income inequality has been far from uniform, and a decline has even been observed in some countries. from the mid-90s until the late 2000s, the oecd area experienced a sort of “inequality convergence”, as inequality increased in countries such as sweden, denmark and finland, but fell in countries such as turkey, mexico and chile. within countries, indicators of inequality, such as the gini coefficient, say little about who has benefited or lost from these trends. a closer look at the situation of households provides a more complete picture and shows that in many oecd countries, gains in disposable incomes have fallen short of increases in gdp. this has been particularly the case for poorer households: in nearly all oecd countries for which data are available, gdp growth was substantially higher than households’ income growth in the lowest quintile. middle income households have generally fared better, even though they also lag behind gdp growth in a large number of countries. there is a growing gap between low- and middle-income households which is particularly pronounced in finland, israel, sweden, spain and the us. more generally, growing income disparities between lowand middle-income households have been more widespread and pronounced than the average, as measured by the gini coefficient. some countries have seen widening disparities in the lower half of income distribution, taking place even when overall inequality has been narrowing–this pattern is particularly striking in spain. in other countries, such as australia, the united kingdom and the us, between 20% and 50% of total income gains generated have accrued to the top 1% of households, pointing to rising inequalities also within the upper half of income distribution. as oecd countries try to encourage recovery, how do growth enhancing policies affect income inequality? identifying the trade-offs between growth and inequality is no simple task. true, in a majority of oecd countries, gdp growth over the past two or three decades has been associated with growing income disparities. recent oecd work has shown that this increase to a large extent reflects skill-biased technological change (oecd @ 100). however, the potential policy drivers of these changes in income distribution–within and between countries–are less clear. to shed light on this issue, one recent study by causa et al. has investigated the long-run impact that structural reforms have had on gdp per capita and household income distribution. based on this analysis, reforms that favour growth can be distinguished according to whether they increase, reduce or have no impact on disposable income inequality. it reveals some interesting trends. indeed, several growth-enhancing reforms contributed to narrower inequality by delivering stronger income gains for households at the bottom of the distribution compared with the average household. such is the case, for instance, of reducing regulatory barriers to domestic competition, trade and inward foreign direct investment, as well as stepping up job-search support and activation programmes. however, a tightening of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed lifts average household incomes in the study, but reduces disposable incomes at the bottom of the distribution, an indication that it may raise inequality. finally, a few reforms leading to higher gdp per capita have an even impact on all households, regardless of income group. examples include measures that aim at promoting investment in information and communications technology and at raising the average level of education in the working age population, as well as reductions in marginal income taxes for wage earners. all of this begs another question much debated nowadays: does growing inequality undermine growth? a certain degree of income and wealth inequality is a characteristic of market economies, which are based on trust, property rights, enterprise and the rule of law. the notion that one can enjoy the benefits from one’s own efforts has always been a powerful incentive to invest in human capital, new ideas and new products, as well as to undertake risky commercial ventures. but beyond a certain point, and not least during an economic crisis, growing income inequalities can undermine the foundations of market economies. they can eventually lead to inequalities of opportunity. this smothers social mobility, and weakens incentives to invest in knowledge. the result is a misallocation of skills, and even waste through more unemployment, ultimately undermining efficiency and growth potential. on the face of it, all of this may seem to make perfect sense, but finding supporting evidence of a clear relationship between growth and inequality is far from straightforward. knowing the initial level of inequality as well as the shape of income distribution, for instance, whether there is a relatively large middle class or if inequality is driven relatively more by income development in the bottom or upper part of the distribution, is important. indeed, inequality in different parts of income distribution can affect gdp differently: in developing countries, inequalities in the upper end are sometimes associated with positive effects on gdp, while inequalities in the bottom end can induce negative effects. to explore the question further, our study estimated a relationship for gdp per capita in which a change in income inequality was added to standard growth drivers such as physical and human capital. the idea was to test whether the change in income inequality over time has had a significant impact on gdp per capita on average across oecd countries, and if this influence differs according to whether inequality is measured in the lower or upper part of the distribution. the results show that the impact is invariably negative and statistically significant: a 1% increase in inequality lowers gdp by 0.6% to 1.1%. so, in oecd countries at least, higher levels of inequality can reduce gdp per capita. moreover, the magnitude of the effect is similar, regardless of whether the rise in inequality takes place mainly in the upper or lower half of the distribution. causa, orsetta, alain de serres and nicolas ruiz (2014), “can growth-enhancing policies lift all boats?

798@Netherlands: Make economic, innovation and territorial reforms work together to boost growth and competitiveness, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/netherlands-make-economic-innovation-and-territorial-reforms-work-together-to-boost-growth-and-competitiveness.htm@"24/04/2014 - the netherlands is gradually emerging from a double-dip recession with strengthened public finances and reforms on track to improve the labour and housing markets and the health care and pension systems. these reforms are paying off, says the oecd. growth is expected to reach 1% this year and 1.3% in 2015.despite the overall positive outlook, important challenges remain according to three new oecd reports. potential growth is about two percentage points lower than in 2000, and the country’s large banking sector is exposed to high household indebtedness. small and medium sized businesses have difficulties accessing the credit needed for their development, which in turn can hamper the innovation required to secure strong economic growth in the future.presenting the economic survey of the netherlands today alongside reviews of dutch innovation and territorial policy, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “the openness of the dutch economy is a source of strength but with growth in europe and the rest of the world poised to remain moderate at best, the country cannot expect a strong economic push from abroad. getting the domestic policies right has become more important than ever.”“the reforms identified in these three reports are self-reinforcing”, mr gurría added. “strengthening the balance sheets of banks and households can benefit the economy as a whole. sharpening innovation policy can contribute to advancing the country’s competitive edge in key sectors. and improving urban and territorial policy can help ensure that dutch cities maximise their potential in terms of productivity and lifting living standards across the country."" (read the speech)the oecd economic survey of the netherlands argues that falling house prices have meant that many homes are worth less than the mortgages being paid on them. nominal prices have dropped by 20% since their peak in early 2008, and one third of all households now have negative home equity.the survey says that when the housing market starts to durably recover, higher down payments and regular amortisation requirements should be incentivised for all mortgages to ensure that the principal is not too high and its repayment not left to the end of the loan period. it recommends reducing the maximum loan-to- value ratio to below the value of the property and accelerating the reduction of mortgage interest relief. the survey also recommends that banks increase their capital adequacy ratios by issuing equity and retaining earnings. this will increase their resilience to housing sector developments.the oecd review of innovation policy in the netherlands says that with its world-class research universities and the technological capabilities of its companies, the country is one of the most advanced knowledge economies in europe. however, the report recommends doing more to engage small innovative businesses in the “top sector” strategy which focuses public resources on strengthening sectors where dutch firms already excel. the review also suggests increasing support for business innovation through joint r&d projects with research institutions rather than just through r&d tax credits.the oecd territorial review of the netherlands recommends the creation of a national framework for urban policy to enhance the economic performance of cities. it suggests providing a longer timeframe for the current decentralisation and territorial reforms to allow local staff to adjust and for greater involvement by citizens. it also recommends aligning the top sector innovation strategy with the eu regional cluster policy in order to provide more coherent local incentives.for further information journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division."
799@How to improve Israel’s health-care system@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz5j1sltwtb-en@israelis enjoy higher life expectancy and have a much younger demographic profile than most oecd countries. however, the demand for health care is expanding rapidly due to population growth and ageing. also, the country’s wide socio-economic divides are reflected in differences in health outcomes. to date the health-care system, centred on four health funds, is widely acknowledged as providing a basket of universal services, with good quality primary and secondary care, while also accommodating demand for private health care. however, there are challenges and tensions in the system. currently the authorities are having to rapidly expand the number of places in medical schools and nurse training because large cohorts of health-care professionals are heading for retirement. more broadly, there are concerns that the core notion of a universal basket of services is being eroded by co-payments and the increasing demand for the additional services and options provided by private insurance. although the quality of care is generally good, in hospital care there is room to improve data and concern that overcrowding may become chronic. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic review of israel (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economicsurvey- israel.htm).
800@How to improve taxes and transfers in Israel@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz5j1t07vs0-en@ensuring tax and transfer systems bring sufficient revenue to reach macroeconomic fiscal targets, address societal goals in re-distribution and social welfare, recognise the influence taxation has on businesses’ competitiveness and adequately address environmental externalities is a tough challenge, arguably more so in israel than in many other oecd countries. high interest payments and large defence spending make deficit and debt reduction more difficult, socio-economic divides remain wide and as a small-open economy israel is highly exposed to mobile international capital and competition over international investment. and, as elsewhere, the incorporation of environmental issues into the tax system remains only partial. this review examines ways forward for policy on several fronts: indirect taxation; household income tax and social benefits; taxes on property and wealth; business taxation; and evasion, avoidance and administration issues. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic review of israel (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-israel.htm).
801@New evidence on the determinants of industrial specialisation@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz5m893txq2-en@industrial specialization has important implications for economic performance; therefore, understanding its determinants is of key policy relevance. this paper quantifies the relationship between factor endowments, policies and institutions and patterns of industrial specialisation in production using a new cross-country dataset compiled by wiod that includes 37 oecd and non-oecd countries and 26 sectors. an advantage of this database –as compared with those used by previous studies- is that makes it possible to look at industrial specialization in terms of value added instead of gross exports, covering both services and manufactures in a panel of advanced and developing economies. the empirical methodology is based on the idea that industries vary in the conditions that they need for production, and countries differ in their ability to provide for these industry-specific requirements. we find that not only cross-country differences in factor endowments, such as capital and labour, but also differences in investment in r&d and policies or institutions, such as financial development, tariffs and taxes, and product and labour market regulation, can explain cross-country differences in industrial structure.
802@Economic growth from the household perspective: GDP and income distribution developments across OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz5m89dh0nt-en@this paper provides an assessment of how households’ income has fared compared with gdp. while the prime focus is on incomes around the median, attention is paid also to the bottom of the income distribution. thus, one contribution of the paper is to deliver a fresh assessment of the evolution of inequality and poverty across oecd countries over the last fifteen years. the analysis relies on a rich array of indicators, producing new evidence of the various patterns of differences in income distributions across countries and over time. for example, it assesses the extent to which stability in overall income inequality masks compensating changes between the lower and upper halves of the income distribution. also, it explores whether contracting inequalities coexist with increasing poverty. the paper adds to previous studies by introducing, measuring and analysing income polarisation in a cross-country comparative perspective. distinguishing polarisation from inequality and comparing their evolution over time provides new policy-relevant perspectives on the nature of the changing income distribution.
803@Would a growth slowdown in emerging markets spill over to high-income countries? A quantitative assessment@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz5m89p82d8-en@growth in emerging market economies (emes) is set to durably slow from the rates observed over 2010-12 as cyclical effects fade, potential growth declines and external financing conditions tighten. large negative current account balances make some emes vulnerable to sudden reversals in capital flows while exceptionally rapid credit expansions, as those observed in brazil, china, poland and turkey over the past years, may have raised financial risk. this paper assesses recent developments and vulnerabilities in emes and uses macroeconometric model simulations to provide quantitative estimates of spillovers to highincome countries. the results suggest that for each slowdown of 2 percentage points in emes, highincome countries’ growth could be around ⅔ percentage points lower on average, with around ½ percentage point accounted for by trade. experience with past eme crises suggests that this could be exacerbated by effects from exchange rates and by financial market turbulence. oecd countries which would be hit hardest include belgium, japan and the netherlands, reflecting mainly strong trade linkages with emes.
804@Global Economic Outlook - Written Statement for the IMFC@http://www.oecd.org/economy/global-economic-outlook-written-statement-for-the-imfc.htm@angel gurría, secretary-general of the oecd, prepared for the imf/wb spring meetings12 april 2014, washington, d.c. global economic outlooka moderate recovery is under way in major advanced economies after two years of subdued growth. overall, most indications point to a continued underlying strengthening of the pace of growth, helped by accommodative monetary policy and reduced fiscal drag. in recent months there has been an encouraging improvement in the performance of some of the engines of growth in advanced economies. notably, trade growth picked up towards the end of 2013, and a continued increase in the trade intensity of growth is expected this year. after an extended period of subdued growth, business investment also firmed in late 2013 in most major economies. the improvement among advanced economies is also reflected in labour markets. the oecd-wide unemployment rate fell by ½ percentage point in the past year, with steady declines in the united states, japan and the united kingdom and a stabilisation in the euro area as a whole, although unemployment is still rising in some euro area countries. among major emerging-market economies, the outlook is more mixed, with some countries continuing to grow strongly while others, where underlying vulnerabilities have been highlighted by reversals of capital inflows, are experiencing a marked loss of momentum. even so, emerging-market economies now account for over half the world economy and continue to grow more quickly on average than the advanced ecoonomies, so that the bulk of global growth will continue to be generated in lower-income countries. the slowdown in emerging-market economies underlines the fact that while some risks to the outlook have waned in recent months, others remain and new ones are appearing – notably, the geopolitical tensions arising from the situation in ukraine constitute a new source of risk, even if the economic implications remain highly uncertain. the loss of growth momentum among emerging-market economies is one area where existing concerns have intensified. in a number of these economies, the tightening of financial conditions over the past year has weighed on economic activity. indicators of current and near-term prospects for the major emerging economies are generally weaker than previously expected, and as monetary stimulus in the united states is wound down, there are fears of an even sharper slowdown.a full-blown financial crisis appears less likely than in the past, as most emerging-market economies now have flexible exchange rates and large stocks of foreign exchange reserves, and their financial institutions have larger capital buffers than prevailed at the time of earlier shocks. nevertheless, some countries are still dependent on portfolio inflows and short-term loans from foreign banks, and have a high share of debt in total foreign liabilities and domestic companies with large foreign currency debts. the illiquidity problems that could arise from capital outflows from these countries have yet to be tested. in china, the authorities face the challenge of slowing rapid credit expansion and rebalancing growth from investment to consumption without significant disruption. moreoever, the off-balance sheet activity of banks will need to be carefully managed. another risk for some oecd economies is related to deflation in a background of weak activity, further hindering the recovery of demand. inflation is well below target in the euro area and the united states, and while japan has moved out of deflation, a good part of the jump in the price level has been driven by yen depreciation and energy price increases over the past year. growth in the united states should be sufficient to gradually erode economic slack and drive inflation back up towards its target. in japan, the headline rate will be boosted by the rise in the consumption tax rate that took effect on 1 april and monetary policy is expected to remain expansionary, while output is already close to potential. thus, while japanese inflation may not reach the central bank’s target by 2015, it should remain positive, confirming the break with years of deflation. by contrast, in the euro area inflation is projected to remain well below target for an extended period, as the economy continues to grow below potential and credit growth remains negative. while deflation is not a central scenario in any of the main oecd economies, the euro area appears to be at a higher risk of slipping into negative inflation or a prolonged period of very low inflation.macroeconomic and financial policy directionsthe modest recovery in the oecd, with still-substantial slack in many economies and limited inflationary pressures, means that monetary policies should remain very accommodative. nonetheless, a scaling-down of stimulus should begin in countries, like the united states, where a cyclical recovery is relatively well established. even in the united states, the weakness of some recent indicators has fanned doubts about the strength of the recovery, although it is clear that unusual weather was a contributing factor. the continued uncertainty about the strength of the us recovery, however, together with the volatility that the winding down of stimulus by the federal reserve has created in some emerging markets, mean that it would be best to proceed cautiously, with a careful communications policy to smooth expectations. meanwhile, in the euro area and japan, where the recovery is less established and inflation remains below target, the degree of monetary policy stimulus should be maintained or even increased.some progress has been made towards repairing the credit transmission mechanism in the euro area, but more is needed. the decisions taken to establish a single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism are welcome, but the resources envisaged for bank resolution risk being inadequate and the decision-making process too complex, suggesting a possible need to strengthen these aspects of the new architecture. in the near term, the authorities must ensure that the asset quality review and stress tests planned over the coming year are credible. to minimise the risk of renewed tensions, it is crucial to clarify how any identified capital shortfalls will be rectified, making sure that the deadlines for recapitalisation are not so distant as to undermine investors’ confidence. budget deficits are narrowing in most major advanced economies, and given high and still-rising government debt burdens, consolidation efforts need to be maintained. in the united states and the euro area, however, the considerable progress already made means that consolidation can slow this year relative to 2013, reducing the drag on growth. by contrast, japan is faced with the need to implement steady consolidation for a number of years in order to restore fiscal sustainability. in china, growth is around trend and inflation well contained, but monetary and macroprudential policy need to restrain credit growth, which would help address the growing vulnerability of the financial system. further interest rate liberalisation, in particular for household deposits, is also called for. fiscal policy in china is broadly neutral, but the central government recognises that it needs to impose harder budget constraints on local governments, improve transparency and better monitor local government spending.other emerging-market economies are typically more exposed to swings in capital flows and exchange rate pressures, and in some cases these pressures may force a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored, even where growth is weak. in a few cases it may be possible to ease fiscal policy to offset the contractionary effect of tighter monetary policy, but some emerging economies are constrained by the need to reduce budget deficits.creating jobs and protecting the vulnerablein many countries, the labour market still bears the scars of the financial and economic crisis. despite some recent improvement, in most major oecd economies unemployment, and especially long-term unemployment, remains high, and many workers are underemployed. in many emerging-market economies, a large proportion of employment is informal, providing lower wages, higher income inequality, fewer benefits and lower labour standards than formal sector jobs. the weakness of demand has hindered job creation, with youth, the low-skilled and immigrants generally being hit the hardest. unemployment among young adults reaches levels of 50% or more in some countries, and their transition into the world of work is not always successful. even the countries that have weathered the crisis without a major increase in unemployment face dissatisfaction with the quality of jobs. the objective of policy makers thus needs to be broadened from ensuring that people have a job to ensuring that peole have a good job. while spurring demand remains the key policy priority to create jobs, this should be complemented by a range of other measures. the experience of oecd countries since the crisis underlines the importance of active labour market policies, especially training programmes and higher spending on public employment services to ensure that resources devoted to job-research assistance are commensurate with the increased task. structural labour market reforms can also encourage the creation of more and better-quality jobs and improve the chances of many, including the youth and other new entrants to the labour market. given the difficult labour market context, special attention should be given to supporting the most vulnerable groups in the transition. tax simplification and extensions of social insurance coverage are among the measures that can help to tackle high rates of informality in many emerging-market economies.structural policies for resilience and inclusive growththe growth slowdown in both advanced and emerging-market economies since the crisis appears to reflect a combination of cyclical weakness and structural deficiencies. competition-enhancing product market reforms, particularly in service sectors, such as retail trade and professional services, are needed to stimulate growth. in addition, countries should also adopt more effective policies to boost their innovation capacity and investment in knowledge-based assets. innovation can help accelerate the recovery and support sustainable growth. it is a powerful engine for development and for addressing social and global challenges. policies that provide a conducive business environment and invest in the knowledge infrastructure underlying innovation could play a key role in generating employment and enhancing productivity growth through cutting edge knowledge creation, application and diffusion.growth-enhancing structural reforms can also help improve macroeconomic fundamentals in emerging-market economies under financial market pressure by boosting investors’ confidence. in particular, emerging-market economies could raise comparatively low levels of labour productivity by reducing still-high regulatory barriers to competition and restrictions to foreign direct investment and trade, developing infrastructure, and improving access to education and teaching quality.but while growth-friendly structural policies can help invigorate investment, revive trade growth and drive innovation via stronger competition, sustainable growth is about more than that. we also must make growth more equal. the rise in inequality that occurred in recent decades has, if anything, picked up pace since the crisis. it has become increasingly clear that the benefits of growth do not automatically ‘trickle down’ to all sectors of society, and high levels of income inequality are associated with lower social mobility, making it harder for talented and hard-working people to get the rewards they deserve. this has serious social and economic consequences. more attention will have to be paid to measuring and improving wellbeing, which will not always be the same as achieving output growth. the oecd has been examining new approaches to economic challenges where growth, equity, environmental concerns and wellbeing are taken into joint consideration, with a view to developing a multi-disciplinary approach allowing a better understanding of the interconnectedness of different policy areas. pro-growth policies have to be combined with policies to foster new sources of employment, including policies that allow young firms to experiment and ensure a level playing field for new and innovative firms, paying more attention to job quality, to invest in education, skills and life-long learning for all and to ensure fairness in the tax system. it is also critical to pay more attention to trade-offs and complementarities when designing and implementing structural reforms, particularly between growth and broader welfare. countries also need to begin the long-term transformation required to deal with the effects of ageing, not only on pensions, health and long-term care systems but also on economic development more broadly.
805@Europe’s reforms beginning to pay off but continued effort needed, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/europe-reforms-beginning-to-pay-off-but-continued-effort-needed.htm@"03/04/2014 - action taken by many european countries to return their public finances to health are beginning to pay off, says the oecd. the euro area economies which emerged from the crisis with serious current account deficits are now in surplus. debt-to-gdp ratios are stabilising and market tensions have abated.although europe’s economies are slowly growing again, they face daunting challenges. joblessness remains high, and youth unemployment in some countries has risen above 30%.two new oecd reports – on the euro area and on the eu as a whole – set out the policies needed to reinforce sustainable economic growth and tackle the increase in inequality across european society.the euro area survey says the methodology for banks’ asset risk weighting should be improved and made more transparent. it welcomes the development of the single supervisory mechanism but, in assessing risk, suggests more attention should be given to the “leverage ratio”, which measures a bank’s capital relative to its non-weighted assets.at the same time, greater competition is essential to promote the labour and product market mobility necessary for dynamic economies to thrive. the economic survey of the eu says a number of countries such as ireland, greece, portugal and spain have made considerable progress in implementing the structural reforms needed to modernise their economies.but it adds that deeper and broader action is needed across europe. initiatives such as the european semester and horizon 2020, designed to support growth and innovation have only had limited effect so far as national ownership has been weak and regulatory costs high, the report adds.to reinvigorate the single market, the european services directive needs to go further, the report says. different rules across eu countries make it hard for firms to adapt. co-operation between national regulators could be strengthened and labour mobility boosted by developing automatic recognition of qualifications.progress toward a low carbon economy should remain a priority, and the eu should adopt an ambitious 2030 emissions target. the renewable energy target and subsidy schemes should avoid creating distortions within the single market.overviews of the economic surveys of the euro area and of the european union are available at www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division (news.contact@oecd.org; tel +33 1 45249700)."
806@Short-term indicator models for quarterly GDP growth in the BRIICS: a small-scale bridge model approach@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz5t6b77rg4-en@this paper extends the oecd economics department’s suite of short-term indicator models for quarterly gdp growth, which currently cover only the g7 countries, to the briics countries. reflecting the relative scarcity of high-quality macroeconomic time series, the paper adopts a small-scale bridge model approach. the results suggest that in terms of short-term forecast accuracy for the first and second quarter following the most recent gdp release these models outperform simple autoregressive or constant growth benchmarks. the small-scale indicator models would have allowed the identification of the growth slowdown during the global crisis of 2008-09 and the subsequent rebound several months ahead of official gdp releases. overall, forecast accuracy appears to be similar to that of the existing indicator model suite for the g7 countries, especially once the higher gdp growth volatility in most briics is accounted for.
807@The prudential regulation of financial institutions: why regulatory responses to the crisis might not prove sufficient@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-prudential-regulation-of-financial-institutions_5jz6zgzzw8s4-en@it is now six years since a devastating financial and economic crisis rocked the global economy. supported strongly by the g20 process, international regulators led by the financial stability board have been working hard ever since to develop new regulatory standards designed to prevent a recurrence of these events. these international standards are intended to provide guidance for the drawing up of national legislation and regulation, and have already had a pervasive influence around the world. this paper surveys recent international developments concerning the prudential regulation of financial institutions: banks, the shadow banking system and insurance companies. it concludes that, while substantial progress has been made, the global economy nevertheless remains vulnerable to possible future financial instability. this possibility reflects three sets of concerns. first, measures taken to manage the crisis to date have actually made the prevention of future crises more difficult. second, the continuing active debate over virtually every aspect of the new regulatory guidelines indicates that the analytical foundations of what is being proposed remain highly contestable. third, implementation of the new proposals could suffer from different practices across regions. looking forward, the financial sector will undoubtedly continue to innovate in response to competitive pressures and in an attempt to circumvent whatever regulations do come into effect. if we view the financial sector as a complex adaptive system, continuous innovation would only be expected. this perspective also provides a number of insights as to how regulators should respond in turn. not least, it suggests that attempts to reduce complexity would not be misguided and that complex behavior need not necessarily be accompanied by still more complex regulation. removing impediments to more effective self-discipline and market discipline in the financial sector would also seem recommended.

812@Strengthening Poland’s Competitiveness – OECD Recommendations@http://www.oecd.org/economy/strengthening-poland-competitivenessoecd-recommendations.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at a seminar in polandmr. president, ladies and gentlemen,it is a great pleasure for me to be here today to lead off the discussion of how to make the polish economy fit to compete in the global economy. thanks to poland’s impressive overall economic performance over the last decade, the large gdp per capita gap with your european neighbours has narrowed substantially. important reforms have helped to achieve this catch up. for instance, the country has reformed its educational system and upgraded its transport infrastructure. but poland can do even better to continue to close the gap in living standards relative to more prosperous european neighbours and boost wellbeing for all poles. improving firms’ competitiveness will be crucial to achieve this goal. today i would like to propose to you a strategy for a more competitive poland that builds on four pillars: labour market reforms, education reforms, product market reforms and reforms of the innovation system.the first pillar: labour market reformspoland’s labour productivity remains low, as does its employment rate. only 60% of all persons of working age are currently employed, which is well below the oecd average of 65%. the economic survey that i launched this morning recommends a number of policy initiatives that could help boost employment. and boosting employment will be essential if you want to overcome the important demographic challenges that you will soon be facing. in our view, poland needs to work on three main fronts:1. you need to reduce labour market dualism to encourage the build-up of human capital. more than one quarter of all workers have a temporary contract, which is the second-highest share in the oecd. for youth the share even exceeds 50%. reducing dualism can for instance be achieved by making all contracts subject to the same tax and social contribution regime and by streamlining legal dismissal procedures.2. second, you need to better activate the unemployed. the unemployment rate currently stands at about 10%, and above 25% for the youth. to tackle this problem, we urge the government to strengthen the public employment services, to tighten work availability and job-search requirements, and to reduce the tax wedge on labour income to make work pay.3. third, you need to make better use of the talents of women and the elderly. only 53% of all women are currently employed, and for the elderly the share is a meagre 39%. here, it is essential to expand childcare facilities and pre-school education, to accelerate the planned increase in women’s retirement age and to adjust the replacement rate of pensions. the second pillar: education reformsbut maximising the use of available labour won’t be enough. if the country wants to be at the forefront of international competition, it has to realise the full potential of its people. that brings me to the second topic: education. first the good news: the 2012 pisa results confirm the beneficial effects of the structural reforms made to school education at the turn of the century, and of the more recent curricular reform. poland is one of the few countries that has seen continued progress in all pisa subject areas since 2000, even for the children with the weakest performance. the education system can now be compared with the best in europe. also the recent improvements to pre-school education are very welcome as they are an important investment in poland’s future.but poland must not rest on these laurels. rather, it is high time to ensure that the vocational and tertiary education systems build on this progress and deliver the levels of quality and relevance that businesses and society need. higher education in poland – both public and private – has grown extremely rapidly since transition, but the system is very fragmented and needs to be streamlined. quality is uneven, calling for a greater use of benchmarking and enhanced institutional autonomy. moreover, greater involvement of employers in higher education is important to ensure that the skills that people acquire better match those that the labour market demands. the third pillar: product market reformswe also advocate reforms to boost product market competition as a means to foster competitiveness. important progress is being made, notably in the area of professional services, which will enable new services firms to expand more easily within the world’s largest market. but there are still a large number of restrictive regulations that substantially hinder business activity. the benefits of reform in this area might be substantial! the gains in productivity in poland could amount to some 14% within the next decade.to realize these gains, registration procedures should be streamlined and the bankruptcy process simplified to facilitate the reallocation of resources to young and innovative firms who are generating about half of all new jobs in most oecd countries. furthermore poland’s business sector is skewed towards micro enterprises with fewer than 10 employees. these firms are far less productive than their slightly larger counterparts. for young high-potential micro firms to achieve greater scale, a consistent reform package is needed to reduce regulatory burdens, increase access to finance, improve labour skills and strengthen management practices. supporting an entrepreneurial mind-set among poland’s youth, including by enhancing entrepreneurship education, would also be beneficial.the economic gains of product market competition are also held back by the direct involvement of the government in potentially competitive sectors. more aggressive privatization in non-strategic sectors would surely yield sizable payoffs. also, public tenders should be based on the best value for money rather than the lowest price. this will require enhancing staff skills to deal with complex criteria when selecting contractors.finally, competition in several network industries needs to be improved. in the rail sector, for instance, the manager of the infrastructure needs to be made fully independent from the operators of rail services. in addition we recommend long fixed-term non-renewable mandates for the presidents of the competition authority and all sector regulators during which they cannot be removed without fault.the fourth pillar: reforms to the innovation systemthe fourth and final pillar of our strategy to boost competitiveness relates to the innovation system. higher investment in knowledge-based capital – an important source of innovation – is crucial to successfully compete in today’s word. business investment in such capital has been increasing faster than in physical capital in many countries but remains relatively low in poland. well-designed tax incentives for r&d as well as direct government support can foster this type of investment.another important source of new growth that polish companies need to embrace is green technologies. poland still heavily relies on coal as a source of energy. but with climate change this won’t be sustainable unless technologies are developed to cap and store emissions. in addition, polish companies might need to invest more in renewable energies such as wind and solar power as these will be the energy sources of the future and the government will need to ensure that policies are well-aligned to send the right signals to investors.a high-quality intellectual property regime is also needed to support the development of knowledge markets, promote knowledge diffusion via the public disclosure of ideas and provide firms with the incentive to innovate. and establishing good framework conditions for other knowledge assets, such as design, data, management and skills, is becoming increasingly important in an ever more knowledge-based world. ladies and gentlemen,a broad agenda of reforms in the four areas i mentioned – labour markets, education, product markets and innovation – should strengthen poland’s economy and allow it to continue its path of convergence towards the income levels of the more affluent oecd economies. at the same time it is important that macroeconomic policies ensure low and stable inflation and sound public finances without restraining necessary spending on education and innovation.we at the oecd stand ready to assist you in your quest to achieve better policies for better lives of all polish citizens.thank you.

adopting ambitious and comprehensive structural reform agendas will offer governments the best chance for a return to strong, sustainable and balanced economic growth that creates jobs and reduces inequality, according to the oecd’s latest going for growth report.the report assesses and compares progress that countries have made on structural reforms since 2012 and takes a fresh look at what else can be done to revive growth and make it more inclusive. the oecd shows that most governments have continued enacting reforms, despite the challenges posed by a subdued growth environment, and highlights actions that can still be taken to boost productivity, raise public sector efficiency, improve educational outcomes, and strengthen labour markets.“signs of a broad-based recovery are becoming more tangible, but governments of advanced and emerging economies now face the risk of falling into a low-growth trap,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said during a launch event in sydney.“australia has focused its g20 presidency on promoting stronger economic growth and employment while making the global economy more resilient to deal with future shocks. the structural reform recommendations the oecd puts forward today offer governments practical ways to boost productivity, lift growth, create jobs and avoid the low-growth trap,” mr gurría said.mr. gurría presented going for growth with australian treasurer joe hockey, ahead of the 22-23 february meeting of g20 finance ministers. he said the report’s analysis of potential reforms to product and labour market regulation, education and training, tax and benefit systems, trade and investment rules and innovation policies are applicable to oecd and g20 countries alike. the going for growth analysis forms the basis of the oecd’s wider contribution to the g20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. “progress on structural reforms can boost growth and living standards worldwide,” mr gurria said. “slowing productivity growth and persistently high unemployment in many advanced economies cry out for further reforms. the vulnerability of many emerging-market economies to the ongoing tightening of monetary policy and the cooling of the commodity boom serves as a reminder that the case for structural reforms is also strong there."" 21/02/2014 (left/right) - australian treasurer joe hockey and oecd secretary-general angel gurría presenting the report at the g20 in sydneygoing for growth 2014 points to countries where reform action has been taken as well as where more needs to be done:• the intensity of reform has remained highest in southern euro area countries like greece, italy, portugal and spain, which are suffering from high long-term unemployment and youth joblessness. considerable action to reform the labour market and break down barriers to job creation and mobility has been taken, in particular in spain in portugal, which have begun growing again.• many emerging economies have yet to launch comprehensive structural reform agendas, and should implement wider efforts to improve education, address physical and legal infrastructure bottlenecks and bring more workers into formal sector employment. mexico stands out among emerging economies for its adoption and ongoing implementation of broad-reaching reforms in competition policy, education, energy, financial services and telecommunications.• in oecd countries which face particularly rapid population ageing, such as japan, korea and germany, bringing more women into the labour market and ensuring that they are fully integrated remains a key challenge.• advanced and emerging economies are both encouraged to boost competition across their economies. another country hard hit by the crisis – ireland - has made the most progress on bankruptcy reform and toward creating a more competitive business environment.a special feature of going for growth 2014 assesses the progress countries have made since 2008 toward reducing regulatory barriers. the new oecd product market regulation indicators show that while governments have continued to move towards more competition-friendly regulation, progress has only been modest in most cases (see data visualisation below).competition in network industries and professional services like accounting, architecture, engineering and legal services continues to be held back by regulatory barriers to entry. where regulatory settings have been improved, the legislated changes need to be fully implemented, to ensure the effective easing of administrative burdens on companies and the entry of new firms.further information on going for growth 2014 and detailed country notes are available at: www.oecd.org/eco/growth/goingforgrowth.htm.for further information, journalists should contact lawrence speer (+33 6 01 49 68 91) or the oecd media division (+33 1 45 24 97 00)."

(read the full speech) the survey points out that finland's population is ageing more rapidly than in most oecd countries, exerting growing pressure on public finances, notably via pension and health care spending, and a shrinking workforce. although employment among older workers is on the rise, the effective retirement age remains relatively low, as many workers retire at the age of 63, despite financial incentives to work longer.further pension reform, including gradual increases of the retirement age and the end of part-time pensions, will be needed to counter projected increases in pension spending, which is set to rise by more than 3% of gdp by 2030. pension reform should be complemented by measures to lengthen working lives, requiring better integration of older workers through fighting age discrimination and promoting lifelong training.a special chapter of the survey addresses local government finances and the long-standing need for municipal reform. finnish municipalities tend to be small but provide a large share of public services like education, health care and social services.with spending increasing steadily, and some municipalities struggling to align service provision with national standards, the oecd recommends that finland continue promoting the voluntary merger of municipalities, or the scaling back of their public service delivery responsibilities, where possible. local public finances could be further strengthened by modifying the tax mix and reinforcing fiscal rules, according to the survey.the survey encourages further measures to boost innovation and green growth, notably through education and research spending and the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies.an overview of the economic survey of finland is available at www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/finland-2014.htm. for further information, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).read, share or embed the oecd economic survey of finland on your website."
817@Economic crisis provides lessons for new approaches to forecasting, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economic-crisis-provides-lessons-for-new-approaches-to-forecasting.htm@11/02/2014 - extreme volatility during the global financial crisis complicated economic forecasting, leading to large errors that underline the need for better modelling methods and new approaches for making and presenting projections, according to an oecd report.oecd forecasts during and after the financial crisis: a post-mortem says that the organisation’s economic projections under-predicted the depth of the collapse in activity in 2008-09 and over-estimated the pace of recovery in recent years. the degree of forecasting errors seen over the 2007-12 period is similar in size to that seen around the first oil shock in the 1970s.the oecd report analyses the key factors driving forecast errors and draws lessons that can be used to improve its forecasting and analysis.“we have learned a lot from the crisis,” oecd chief economist pier carlo padoan said during a launch event today in london with the london school of economics. ”we have taken steps to improve short-term forecasting models, construct better indicators of financial conditions and explore the risks around our forecasts more systematically,” mr padoan said.the analysis of forecasting offers new insight into how the global economic crisis impacted different countries. forecast errors were larger in the economies that are most open, in terms of trade and finance, suggesting that globalisation has increased exposure to external shocks and made countries more connected than in the past.errors in economic projections were also larger in countries with the most stringent pre-crisis labour and product market regulations, suggesting weaker resilience than in more deregulated economies.the large and negative errors on growth in countries with weak banking systems, confirm that financial factors need to be given more weight in economic models.“the repeated deepening of the euro area sovereign debt crisis took us by surprise, because of the stronger-than-expected feedback between banking and sovereign weaknesses, and this influenced our over-estimation of projected growth during the early stages of the recovery,” mr padoan said.strong moves toward fiscal consolidation have been blamed by some for weaker-than-projected growth, but the oecd finds that this holds true only in some years, and only when greece is included in the analysis. “the oecd did not underestimate fiscal multipliers,” mr padoan said. “it was the repeated assumption that the euro crisis would dissipate over time, and that sovereign bond yield differentials would narrow, that turned out to have been the most important source of error.”the review of forecasting is part of a wider effort at the oecd to better understand the global crisis and use it as a source for the development of new approaches to economic challenges.for further information, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
818@Growth Policies and Macroeconomic Stability@http://www.oecd.org/economy/growth-policies-and-macroeconomic-stability.htm@how do growth-promoting policies affect macroeconomic stability?, oecd economics department policy notes, no. 22macroeconomic shocks as severe and protracted as those since 2007 warrant a reconsideration of the role growth-promoting policies play in shaping the vulnerability and resilience of an economy to macroeconomic shocks. against this background, this paper looks at a vast array of policy recommendations by the oecd that promote long-term growth – contained in going for growth and the economic outlook –and attempts to establish whether they underpin macroeconomic stability or whether there is a trade-off.• oecd policy recommendations aimed at boosting long-run growth often have side effects –positive or negative – on an economy's vulnerability to shocks and their propagation. the great recession has prompted a review of such recommendations and the extent to which they involve trade-offs between long-run growth and stability and how such trade-offs can be mitigated.• the oecd growth study identified financial market deepening as supporting long-term growth, but the role of the financial sector as a source of instability was not considered. robust micro and macroprudential regulation needs to be in place to reap the benefits of deep financial markets without increasing economic instability.• even with such regulation in place, policy may need to react to emerging threats from the financial sector and asset price bubbles.- pursuing price stability over a sufficiently long horizon will allow some leeway for monetary policy to contribute to financial stability. nonetheless, interest rates are a blunt instrument with the costs felt widely across the economy. - a regulatory framework that ensures a higher flexibility of housing supply ought in principle to be good for growth and may reduce the risk of house price bubbles, but at the price of greater volatility of building activity, leaving the overall effect on stability unclear. - both long-run growth and stability will be served by avoiding debt biases in the tax code – particularly for the housing market.• trade and financial openness support long-run growth but create vulnerabilities to external shocks. in addressing external imbalances and the risk of sudden stops of capital flows, fiscal policy may sometimes need to be tighter, impediments to direct and equity investment should be removed, and structural and financial policies more generally reformed to remove biases in capital flows contributing to financial account vulnerabilities.• monetary and budgetary policy settings aimed at low and stable inflation and sound public finances are conducive to long-term growth. sometimes these policies will also help to contain shocks, but there can be trade-offs.- monetary policy that has ensured a firm anchoring of inflation expectations will allow a stronger response to shocks and helps guard against deflationary spirals in the wake of large negative shocks.- raising the inflation target could create additional room for monetary policy to react to a severe downturn, but the transition to a new target will involve costs and if the increase in inflation was substantial it would lead to efficiency losses. - low government debt levels and sustainable fiscal balances provide fiscal policy room to address large, adverse shocks and absorb liabilities held by other sectors. - the strength of the automatic fiscal stabilisers depends on the size and progressivity of the tax system and the generosity of the unemployment insurance system. a generous unemployment insurance system and a large and progressive tax system stabilise the economy, but have detrimental growth effects. making policies state contingent, for instance, by prolonging unemployment benefit payments temporarily during a downswing might ease the trade-off.• labour and product market policies can affect the size and persistence of a shock.- overly tight labour and product market regulations are generally bad for long-term growth. such policy settings may damp the initial impact of a shock, but could raise its persistence. new findings concerning the recent crisis found no damping effects from such settings, but they still led to greater persistence.- a number of labour market policies may harm long-term growth and prolong the duration of a shock. they include restrictive employment protection for regular workers, wider coverage of collective agreements and high replacement rates for unemployment benefits. - labour market policies that promote employment and growth, such as active labour market policies, are conducive to growth because they help contain the threat of hysteresis during a crisis and also lower shock persistence. - short-time working schemes helped cushion the impact of the recent crisis. however, if not well-designed, they may prevent or retard structural adjustment or augment wage pressures, implying a trade-off with long-term performance.- tight product market regulation undermines the capacity of an economy to reallocate resources in the face of a major supply-side shock. light regulation promotes growth and reduces shock persistence.• financial sector policies can also influence how shocks are propagated.- regulation and supervision to ensure that banks are well capitalised and make sufficient provisions increases the robustness of the banking sector in the face of shocks. - in the past, policy advice has not examined ways to deal with debt overhangs. bankruptcy provisions and other institutions that facilitate debt restructuring may help limit the negative drag of deleveraging on consumption and investment. however, this could lead to lenders demanding higher risk premia with potential adverse consequences for growth.

832@The impact of government bond yield increases on banks@http://www.oecd.org/economy/theimpactofgovernmentbondyieldincreasesonbanks.htm@government bond yields have recently increased in many oecd countries from rock-bottom levels and a further increase is likely with the normalisation of monetary policies. a rise in government bond yields can have a negative effect on commercial bank balance sheets, though the full impact is a prioriambiguous, depending on the size, structure and maturity of total bank balance sheets and the extent of hedging in a specific macroeconomic scenario. the focus here is on a limited and illustrative analysis by looking only at the direct impact on banks’ capital via realised losses when bonds are sold or unrealised losses, when bonds are marked to market.unrealised losses of banks due to a rise in government bond yields will increase with the amount of bonds held in the trading book and their maturity. to illustrate the potential scope for such losses, stylised calculations for aggregated banking systems in selected oecd countries have been made. they use data on total banking sector holdings of domestic general government securities, which vary significantly across the analysed countries (see figure below). it is assumed that all these bonds are in the trading book – and therefore marked to market – and that the maturity structure is the same as that of outstanding central government debt, and that bond yields increase by 1 percentage point across the yield curve.the results suggest that, for most of the countries covered, the capital losses due to a 1-percentage point parallel upward shift of the yield curve are small (see figure above). japan appears a notable exception, with japanese banks incurring losses corresponding to 70% of tier 1 capital, but this is likely to be an overestimation given the simplifying assumptions. for example, the bank of japan (2013) estimates – based on disaggregated data – that with the same shock, japanese banks would incur unrealised losses of 6 trillion yen, i.e. only one-fifth of the above estimate. even with a parallel upward shift of the yield curve by 3 percentage points, unrealised losses would be 15.3 trillion yen, i.e. around 35% of tier i capital of large and regional banks. this may be partly due to the fact that the average maturity of bonds held by large and regional banks in japan are around 2.5 and 4 years, respectively, while the average maturity of the japanese central government’s outstanding ordinary bonds is 7.3 years, and that not all bond holdings are marked to market.[1]
833@New econometric estimates of long-term growth effects of different areas of public spending@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/new-econometric-estimates-of-long-term-growth-effects-of-different-areas-of-public-spending_5k3txn15b59t-en@using panel data for oecd countries, this study investigates the extent to which changes in government spending on education, health and other areas influence long-term growth. the results suggest that, if total government spending is kept unchanged, increasing expenditure on health, education and transport raises long-term gdp growth. in contrast, government spending on housing is found to weaken long-term gdp growth. the error-correction specification used allows assessing adjustment speed which, consistent with intuition, is estimated to be slow. according to the econometric results, it takes more than five years for half of the effect of a change in the structure of government spending to be reflected in longterm growth.
834@Cross-country spillovers from fiscal consolidations@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/cross-country-spillovers-from-fiscal-consolidations_5k3txn1mbw8x-en@in many oecd countries, government debt reached levels over recent years that call for reduction over the medium to longer term to ensure public finance sustainability. this paper investigates the international transmission of fiscal consolidation shocks via trade flows. using a measure of exogenous fiscal shocks in export markets, fiscal consolidation spillovers are found to slow domestic growth and decrease employment. when fiscal consolidation efforts are synchronised across partner countries, fiscal policies have large spillover effects on output. spillovers of fiscal consolidations on growth are found to be initially larger between countries belonging to currency unions, though this larger impact vanishes over the medium term. larger spillovers of fiscal consolidation coincide with stronger shifts in bilateral trade flows in currency unions in the short term, despite smaller adjustments in relative exchange rates. spillovers of fiscal consolidation are also found to be more detrimental to domestic growth during economic downturns in export markets.
835@Israel’s economy growing strongly but further efforts needed to improve living standards, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/israels-economy-growing-strongly-but-further-efforts-needed-to-improve-living-standards.htm@8/12/13-israel’s economy is in good shape, but further efforts are needed to fight poverty and close the gap in living standards with other leading nations, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of israel.the survey, presented by oecd secretary-general angel gurría to prime minister benyamin netanyahu during a cabinet meeting, underscores the importance of maintaining prudent macroeconomic frameworks and building momentum behind structural reforms, particularly in education, social and competition policies. it also calls on israel to ensure that environmental externalities are more fully incorporated into government, household and business decisions.“with strong growth projected for the coming two years and unemployment at historically low levels, the near-term outlook for the israeli economy is very auspicious,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said. “to increase well-being and reduce socio-economic gaps, all citizens must have access to good education and opportunities to develop skills. making work pay is the way forward,” mr gurria said (read the full speech).the survey urges continued vigilance of israel’s housing market and points out the need to monitor and respond to financial market risks. when global financial conditions normalise and capital flows stabilise, the authorities should plan to tighten monetary policy, as necessary, while terminating intervention in the foreign‑currency market.on the fiscal front, the oecd warns that measures may be required to raise revenue, particularly beyond 2014, to meet previously announced budgetary targets. introduction of a stronger medium-term perspective in budgeting would improve spending efficiency.the survey encourages further measures to strengthen competition in retail supply chains and reform the electricity sector, and warns against the provision of implicit fuel subsidies in the gas sector.to strengthen israel’s tax and transfer system, tax evasion and avoidance need to be avoided and tax bases need to be broadened. should the need arise to boost revenue, the rates of vat, rather than personal or corporate income tax, could be raised.expansion of the earned-income tax credit would help reduce in-work poverty, but the reduction in the value of child allowance can have adverse effects on low-income households. environmental taxation in the transport sector should focus on raising taxes that influence car use, rather than ownership.population aging and the imminent retirement of many physicians and nurses are putting further strains on the health care system. the survey underscores a need to ensure adequate public resources, strong competition between the health funds, continued expansion of medical schools and nurse training and greater focus on poor households’ health to ensure that public care, with quality services and equal access for all, remains at the core of the system.an overview of the economic survey of israel is available at at www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/israel-2013.htm. for further information, contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
836@Informal employment in Russia: definitions, incidence, determinants and labour market segmentation@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/informal-employment-in-russia_5k3v1tqzmzg7-en@this paper takes stock of informal employment in russia analysing its incidence and determinants. using the regular 2003-11 waves and an informality supplement of the russian longitudinal monitoring survey (rlms) it develops several measures of informal employment and demonstrates that the incidence varies widely across the different definitions. we also show that the determinants of informal employment are roughly stable across the different measures: workers who are males, relatively young, unskilled and employed in construction and trade and related services have a higher likelihood to have an informal job. we also take a look at the issue of labour market segmentation along the informal-formal divide by estimating an informal-formal wage gap at the means and across the entire wage distributions. we find only weak evidence for labour market segmentation in russia when estimating an informal-formal wage gap for salaried workers at the mean. the results of quantile regressions show a wage penalty in the lower half of the distribution and no gap in the upper half for informal employees. in contrast, informal self-employed and entrepreneurs have conditional mean wages that are higher than the mean wages for the formally employed. across the entire wage distribution, however, we find a negative wage gap in the lowest quartile and a strongly positive wage gap in the highest quartile, pointing to a segmented informal sector with a lower free entry tier and an upper rationed tier. this working paper relates to the 2014 oecd economic survey of the russian federation (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/russia).
837@Growth-promoting policies and macroeconomic stability@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/growth-promoting-policies-and-macroeconomic-stability_5k3xqsz7c8d2-en@policy reforms aimed at boosting long-run growth often have side effects – positive or negative – on an economy’s vulnerability to shocks and their propagation. macroeconomic shocks as severe and protracted as those since 2007 warrant a reconsideration of the role growth-promoting policies play in shaping the vulnerability and resilience of an economy to macroeconomic shocks. against this background, this paper looks at a vast array of policy recommendations by the oecd that promote longterm growth – contained in going for growth and the economic outlook – and attempts to establish whether they underpin macroeconomic stability or whether there is a trade-off.

839@Global spillovers from the growth slowdown in emerging market economies@http://www.oecd.org/economy/global-spillovers-in-emes.htm@a concern highlighted in the latest global economic outlook, june 2017 is the growth slowdown in the large emerging market economies (emes). with the six briics alone now accounting for 30% of world gdp (at ppp rates) and 15% of global equity markets, a slowdown in emes has larger effects on the global economy than in the past, via trade and financial cross-border linkages.indeed, a sharp slowdown in domestic demand in emes, possibly brought about by both tighter financial conditions as us treasury yields rise and a slowdown in trend growth, would have noticeable trade spillover effects. global macro-model simulations suggest that a one-year, 2 percentage point decline in domestic demand growth in all non-oecd countries apart from china (where growth is holding up) could lower oecd gdp growth by around 0.4 percentage points in the first year (see first figure below).the simulation points to considerable cross-country differences. the us economy would be relatively sheltered compared to japan and china, reflecting their stronger trade linkages with other non-oecd economies, both in gross and in value-added terms (see second figure below).trade linkages to emes also appear important for commodity producers and countries strongly linked in global value chains. countries with both sizeable trade exposures and large current account deficits, such as turkey and south africa, are particularly vulnerable to a sharp slowing in external demand. a further effect would come via lower commodity prices, which would hurt commodity exporters, including australia and chile and also non-oecd countries such as brazil, russia and south africa, while giving some support to commodity importers.financial linkages will raise the global impact of a growth slowdown in the emes still further. an orderly but widespread slowdown would reduce asset values and lower earnings from investments in the emes. exposures via these channels appear non-negligible; in 2010 over one-third of the profits of majority-owned foreign affiliates of us parent companies came from affiliates in non-oecd economies. also, banking sector exposures to emes have risen since the crisis and are sizeable in several oecd countries (see figure below). thus large spillovers via financial channels remain possible if an orderly slowdown in emes’ growth were to turn into a systemic event through financial vulnerabilities in some emes.
840@Greece: Structural reforms under way but more progress needed in boosting market dynamism@http://www.oecd.org/economy/greece-structural-reforms-under-way-but-more-progress-needed-in-boosting-market-dynamism.htm@27/11/2013-greece has made impressive headway in consolidating its public finances and undertaking key structural reforms to boost productivity and enhance competitiveness. these reforms need to be implemented swiftly and in full to put greece on a path of stronger, more inclusive growth, according to the oecd.in its latest economic survey of greece, the oecd says the crisis has been much deeper than expected, leading to a sharp contraction in activity that has pushed unemployment up to almost 28% of the labour force, created hardship for vulnerable social groups, and is posing risks to the sustainability of the country’s government debt.presenting the survey in athens, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “for the reform efforts to succeed and be accepted by citizens, it is imperative that both the costs and the benefits of adjustment are shared fairly. (read the full speech) ”he acknowledged that the country’s government debt trajectory has worsened as a result of slower-than-expected growth, despite the 2012 restructuring.“if greek growth again disappoints, or deflation persists – even after the implementation of structural reforms - then it will be extremely difficult to reach the debt-to-gdp target of 120% by 2020. in this case, serious consideration should be given to reducing the current debt burden,” he said.the survey says accelerating and broadening the structural reform programme is essential for a sustainable recovery. it says privatisations should be speeded up, particularly in the energy sector and in railways, regional airports, ports and real estate.the report recommends better targeting of benefits, including a minimum income scheme, to strengthen the safety net. health care cuts must focus on further reducing inefficiencies while safeguarding cost-effective and critical services.the oecd’s competition assessment of laws and regulations in greece complements the survey by recommending policies to achieve greater competition, widen consumer choice and lower prices. the competition assessment scrutinises more than a thousand pieces of legislation in four sectors: food processing, retail, building materials and tourism. if the recommendations are fully implemented, the benefit to the greek economy in efficiency gains and increased purchasing power for consumers is estimated at 5.2 billion euros a year, or 2.5% of gdp.the oecd is also working with greece to reduce administrative red tape. it estimates that by lifting regulatory obstacles in a number of sectors by 25%, businesses could save around 1.8 billion euros annually, while supporting growth in productivity.for further information, to obtain a copy of the economic survey of greece or the competition assessment review of greece, journalists are invited to contact the oecd’s media division, tel: +33 1 24 45 97 00.read the oecd economic survey of greece online, share, link or embed on your website.
841@Keeping the momentum of the structural reform agenda in Europe@http://www.oecd.org/economy/keeping-the-momentum-of-the-structural-reform-agenda-in-europe.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the european parliament econ committeebrussels, 26 november 2013ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to address the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament, now for the second time.the crisis which hit us over five years ago has left us four legacies: first; low growth. as shown in the latest economic outlook that we launched last week, world gdp growth is expected to reach only 2.7% in 2013, the lowest rate in the last four years. while we expect global growth rates to move again towards 4 per cent in 2015 (its average rate in the decade to 2008), the recovery will be uneven. while growth in the us is picking up (3% expected in 2014), potential downside risks remain in the form of fiscal brinkmanship. in japan, growth is expected to slow down (1.5% in 2014) and there is the big question over the high debt burden. the emerging market economies’ high growth rates are also expected to come down. as you know, in europe the recovery is lagging and uneven. growth is resuming at a low pace in most eu countries outside the euro area. but in 2013 the euro area itself will experience a second year of recession (-0.4% growth), and a slow improvement over the near term (1.0% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2015).the second legacy of the crisis is unemployment, which remains unacceptably high, at 8% this year for the oecd countries on average, and falling only slightly to 7.5% by 2015. in the euro area, we expect unemployment to hit 12% this year and only to fall back below this level after mid-2015. furthermore, long-term unemployment is increasing. long-term joblessness ranges between 45-55% in some european countries, including spain and italy.youth unemployment has also reached alarming levels in some of these countries (around 60% in greece, 56% in spain). youth (15-24 years old) not in employment, education or training (neets) in these same countries has doubled since the onset of the crisis to over 20% of the total youth population in 2012. there is a real risk of a lost generation.third, the crisis has intensified the increase in income inequality. during the worst years of the crisis – between 2007 and 2010 - market income inequality in the oecd went up more than in the preceding twelve years. but growing inequality is not new, we have been experiencing it for the past three decades. in oecd countries today, the average income of the richest 10% of the population is about nine and a half times that of the poorest 10% – a ratio of 9.5 to 1. in the mid-80s, that same ratio was 7.5 to 1. in the us, the increase in this ratio has been even more dramatic, from 11 to 1 in the mid-80s to about 16 to 1 today. european countries have generally experienced a more muted increased in inequality. for instance, in france and germany, the ratio has gone up from about 5 to 1 in the mid-80s to 7 to 1 today.the fourth, and related, legacy is a loss in public trust in government. this is described in detail in our recent publications “how’s life” and “government at a glance”, which also show similar declines of public trust in banks, the judiciary system, and other institutions. according to the “how’s life” report, only 40% of citizens in the oecd trust their national governments – the lowest level since 2006. this ongoing economic weakness is not surprising. it is the result of the malfunctioning of the four main cylinders of the growth engine.first, investment remains weak. in oecd countries, the volume of fixed investment is some 8 per cent below its pre-crisis peak. investment growth is also slowing in the emerging-market economies. growth of investment is below 2%, the slowest in many years and well below trend.second, credit growth remains subdued. the banking sector, particularly in europe, is still going through a painful deleveraging that is bearing on their capacity to lend. bank credit in the euro area fell by 4% in the year to september. in the oecd as a whole, it was flat.third, trade growth is only slowly picking up. in volume terms the ratio of global trade to gdp remains slightly below its pre-crisis level. sluggish trade growth (2 – 3%) reflects several factors, including the weakness of investment that i have already mentioned.fourth, growth in emerging-market economies has slowed down. in the briics, trend growth declined by 1¾ percentage points between 2007 and 2013. this drop was driven by various factors, including ageing, declining investment growth and a slowdown in productivity.for these reasons, strong and sustained growth is unlikely to return on its own. but we urgently need inclusive and green growth to heal the social wounds from the crisis and ensure sustainable development.there are three tools that policymakers have at hand. one, monetary policy has helped much and continues to do so but is close to its limits, as interest rates approach zero and central banks rely heavily on non-conventional tools, such as ‘quantitative easing’, to address deflationary risks. fiscal policy is even more constrained, because of the need for fiscal consolidation. thus, it is important that at least automatic stabilisers are allowed to function, and for more time to be allowed to those countries which are enacting the proper reforms but which are constrained by the sluggish economic environment. the third main tool is structural reform and here we find great scope for bold and ambitious action on several fronts. in europe, the two most pressing structural policy priorities that must be addressed are the challenge of unemployment and the restoration the health of euro area banks.focusing on people and investing in skillspolicy measures to boost job creation need to be cost-effective and focus on the most vulnerable groups. action is needed on both the demand and the supply side of the labour market. labour market programmes, as we have recommended in our youth action plan, can make a difference, including higher impact activation policies, effective counselling, job-search assistance, and even temporary hiring subsidies for the low skilled. also necessary are better incentives for job-seekers and greater flexibility in labour markets, leading to a faster, clearer convergence path for those countries which allowed wages to rise faster than productivity for the better part of the last 15 years, together with.greater investment in training would facilitate the re-employment of jobseekers, especially those with low or obsolete skills. as we showed in the “adult skills survey” - the “pisa for adults”- published last month skills are very unequally distributed and this is a major source of entrenched inequality. training programmes are not always effective or well-targeted. one example is the adult training system in france. in our recent brochure on french competitiveness, we called for a major reform of this system, which cost about 32 billion euros in 2012 (same as unemployment insurance), but of which only 12% went to the unemployed.eliminating the financial drag the second most burning priority is to address the weaknesses in the european banking system to strengthen financial stability, get credit growing again (which fell by 4% in the year to september in the euro area) and improve the transmission power of monetary policy. banks’ capitalisation is progressing but we know that non-performing loans remain significant and even rising in some countries. to revive credit, europe needs to address fully persisting regulatory forbearance. this means that the real quality of the portfolios, including sovereign debt, needs to be recognised, and banks need to be restructured and recapitalised accordingly, where needed. the forthcoming third round of bank asset quality reviews and stress tests are a crucial step in this process and will have to be implemented rigorously and transparently. and, of course, the euro area also needs to achieve the full banking union with area-wide regulatory, supervisory and resolution authority. bold reforms to better protect the economy from future bank failures should also be considered. separating commercial (deposit-taking) and investment banking activities would help to reduce systemic risks as would the introduction of a minimum leverage ratio, which we suggest should be set at 5%.supporting investment and innovationrestoring growth in europe also requires investment, which remains subdued since the crisis. in particular, investment is needed in infrastructure and knowledge-based capital. higher infrastructure investment will require improving public sector efficiency, and more funding at a time where public finances are heavily constrained. this clearly calls for enhancing private sector participation in this sector, as recommended by the recently approved g20/oecd high-level principles of long-term investment financing by institutional investors. more investment is also needed in knowledge-based capital as source of innovation, which will in turn foster competitiveness, productivity, and job creation. in eu countries like sweden, the netherlands and the united kingdom, most investment is now in such assets and contributes substantially to productivity growth. fostering investment in knowledge-based capital requires more effective policy support for innovation.more generally, improving the functioning of product and labour markets in the euro area would have wide economic gains. according to our analysis, if each euro area country were to move to best practice, aggregate output could increase by 22% by 2060, with even larger gains in countries that are the furthest from such best practice.european rebalancingthese and other structural reforms are already helping to correct economic imbalances. unit labour costs are converging. all the european countries with support programmes or that have been under market pressures have already achieved or are close to achieving current account balance or a slight surplus. this is remarkable! however, the surplus countries also have made considerably less progress, making the adjustment process in europe rather lopsided. germany’s current surplus has even increased slightly to 7%.recovering tax revenuesto support all these initiatives, additional public funding will be needed. putting an end to tax evasion by wealthy individuals and aggressive tax avoidance by multinational companies would be extremely effective. these practices undermine the integrity of tax systems across the world, profoundly distort economic competition, reduce available revenues to meet citizens’ and business demands and dent public trust. the oecd has proposed a roadmap to help governments address these issues, the action plan on base erosion and profit shifting. countries have already started working together along the lines of this action plan suppported and mandated by the g8 and the g20 and we highly appreciate the extensive cooperation with the european union on this project. another challenge is the fight against offshore tax evasion. for many years, the oecd and the eu have been working together in this direction. with your support, as well as that of the g20, we are now progressing towards a new, more ambitious, single global standard for automatic exchange of tax information. following our recent global forum in indonesia, the challenge is now to put our commitments into action and implement a truly global standard for an increasingly borderless world, which we hopen to achieve by july 2014.trade and climate changeeurope also needs to throw its full weight behind two other key global priorities: maintaining open markets for trade and investment and promoting a move towards zero carbon emissions. our analysis shows that achieving the wto reform goals set for bali would reduce trading costs by 15% for emes and 10% for advanced economies (a 1% reduction in trading costs equates to about €30 billion). we also have great hopes set in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip), which would the most significant bilateral free trade agreement to date, covering almost 30% of world merchandise trade and 20% of global foreign direct investment. the potential welfare gains to the european union and the united states could be as large as 3 – 3.5% of gdptackling climate change should also be a top priority, as i highlighted at an lse event in london at the beginning of october. as we approach the conference of the parties in late 2015 in paris (via warsaw), we need to start taking action now to put us on a pathway to achieve zero net greenhouse emissions globally in the second half of this century. the scale of investment needed to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel can give a huge boost to growth, as well as making growth greener.ladies and gentlemen,the growth-oriented policy agenda i have highlighted is an ongoing one. it will require bold and ambitious reforms in some countries and a shared sense of purpose at the international level. i look forward to building on the very strong cooperation we have established with the european parliament and with this committee. and i very much hope also that these visits will continue to be a regular feature under the next parliament.thank you for your attention and i look forward to your questions.

843@Environmental policies and productivity growth - a critical review of empirical findings@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/environmental-policies-and-productivity-growth_5k3w725lhgf6-en@the economic effects of environmental policies are of central interest to policymakers. the traditional approach sees environmental policies as a burden on economic activity, at least in the short to medium term, as they raise costs without increasing output and restrict the set of production technologies and outputs. in contrast, the porter hypothesis claims that well-designed environmental policies can provide a ‘free lunch’ – encouraging innovation, bringing about gains in profitability and productivity that can outweigh the costs of the policy. this paper reviews the empirical evidence on the link between environmental policy stringency and productivity growth, and the various channels through which such effects can take place. the results are ambiguous, in particular as many of the studies are fragile and context-specific, impeding the generalisation of conclusions. practical problems related to data, measurement and estimation strategies are discussed, leading to suggestions how they can be addressed in future research. these include: improving the measurement of environmental policy stringency; investigating into effects of different types of instruments and details of instrument design; exploiting cross-country variation; and the complementary use of different levels of aggregation.

848@France : Reinforcing competitiveness is key to boosting jobs and growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/france-reinforcing-competitiveness-is-key-to-boosting-jobs-and-growth.htm@"14/11/2013 - improving france’s competitiveness is essential to boost the economic growth needed to create jobs and allow citizens and businesses to develop their full potential, according to a new oecd report.france : redresser la competitivité identifies a number of weaknesses in the economy where reforms should be a priority. a key focus is the need to ensure that the country’s education system and professional training infrastructure provide people with the right skills to succeed in a globalised economy.the general level of education in france has progressed strongly in recent decades but the gap between the performance of good and weak students remains large, making the french education system one of the most unequal among oecd countries. the impact of socio-economic background on student performance is also one of the highest among the countries surveyed.the report recommends assigning the most effective teachers to the weakest schools. professional training is highly costly, not best adapted to needs and should be reviewed. the budget dedicated to professional training is around € 32 billion, equal to almost half of the total expenditure on unemployment insurance. the oecd recommends better targeting and the implementation of a system of vouchers to reach the most in need.the report says product market regulation is stricter than the average in advanced economies, particularly in network industries and in the retail sector, where the margins imposed are among the highest in oecd countries. competition restrictions also weigh on activity in the area of services to business.oecd secretary–general angel gurría said reforms are needed both to tackle inequality and support growth: “the government and social partners have made progress but must now be more ambitious in their aims, so that they correspond to a vision of society which is committed to all its citizens, including the most vulnerable.” (read the full speech in french).the report, which mr gurría presented to french president françois hollande last week, points to a number of other key areas where the oecd recommends action to support productivity and competitiveness:• reinforce research and innovation, an area that the report says is weak and imbalanced in france. research and development, particularly among small and medium-sized companies, are insufficient and links between private and public research tenuous. reforms over recent years are, however, beginning to bear fruit, but must be pursued, reinforced and evaluated.• improve public sector efficiency. reduce the regulatory burden, simplify the way decentralised authorities are organised and rationalise the overlapping «millefeuille » of agencies, says the report. an approach to public service based on performance needs to be developed.• reform taxes. france’s relatively high levels of labour taxation and minimum wages undermine the employability of low-skilled workers .the numerous tax distortions and exemptions need to be rationalised. the report welcomes the crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi, which will lower labour costs and help increase exports and employment.• reform the labour market. high unemployment among youths and the over 55s combined with the problem of long-term joblessness are major challenges. the oecd recommends aid being targeted to hire and train under-qualified youths and older workers for the skills that will be needed now and in the future and reducing the dualism between temporary and indefinite contracts by reforming job protection rules. the oecd welcomes the government’s “emplois d’avenir” programme to help young people gain their first job.• improve the way the housing market functions. the report argues that the rise in property prices undermines france’s export performance as it attracts capital and labour resources away from more productive sectors of the economy. reforms, including in the area of taxation, are needed to reduce distortions in the housing market.for further information, journalists should contact the oecd media division (news.contact@oecd.org ; tel +3314524 9700)."
849@Productivity measurement with natural capital@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/productivity-measurement-with-natural-capital_5k3xnhsz0vtg-en@traditional measures of multi-factor productivity (mfp) growth generally do not recognise natural capital as inputs into the production process. since productivity growth is measured as the residual between output and input growth, it will pick up the growth in unmeasured inputs, which can lead to a bias. the purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role of natural capital for productivity measurement and as a source of economic growth. to this aim, aggregate economy productivity measures mostly from the oecd productivity database are extended by incorporating natural capital as an additional input factor into the production function. more specifically, this paper considers oil, gas and various minerals as natural capital inputs, drawing on data from the world bank. results suggest that failing to account for natural capital tends to lead to an underestimation of productivity growth in countries where the use of natural capital in production is declining because of a dwindling natural capital stock. in return, productivity growth is sometimes overestimated in times of natural resource booms, if natural capital is not taken into account as an input factor. the direction of the adjustment to productivity growth depends on the rate of change of natural capital extraction relative to the rate of change of other inputs. the extended framework also makes the contribution of natural capital to economic growth explicit. this can be useful for countries relying on nonrenewable resources to better understand the need to develop other sources of growth, for example by investing in human or productive capital, to prepare for times when resources endowments become scarce. while the measurement of natural capital remains very incomplete, leaving out natural forests, water and soil, the measurement framework can readily be applied to more encompassing data on the natural capital stock, once it becomes available.
850@What makes civil justice effective?@http://www.oecd.org/economy/judicialperformance.htm@1. lengthy civil proceedings can be a drag on economic activity. protection of property rights and enforcement of contracts encourage savings and investment while promoting the establishment of economic relationships, bringing positive impacts on competition, innovation, the development of financial markets and growth. 2. the average length of first instance proceedings is around 240 days in the oecd area, but in some countries a trial may require almost twice as many days to be resolved. final disposition of cases may involve a long process of appeal before the higher courts, which in some cases can last more than 7 years. 3. differences in trial length appear to be more related to the structure of justice spending and the structure and governance of courts than to the sheer amount of resources devoted to justice. 4. factors associated with shorter trial length include: larger shares of the justice budget devoted to court computerization; the active management of the progress of cases by courts; the systematic production of statistics at the court level; the existence of specialised commercial courts; systems of court governance in which the chief judge has broader managerial responsibilities (e.g. covering supervision of staff and administration of the budget). 5. there is wide scope for further informatisation of court activities. the majority of courts in oecd countries have electronic forms, websites and electronic registers, but many countries have not yet implemented online facilities and the possibility for lawyers to follow up cases online, or have done so only in a minority of courts. 6. investments in court computerisation lead to higher productivity of judges (measured as cases solved per judge), especially in countries where computer literacy is widespread. 7. reducing high litigation rates can increase civil justice efficiency. lowering the number of new litigation cases per capita – which range across countries from almost 10 cases to less than one case in 100 people – is associated with a significant reduction in the average length of trials. 8. good quality regulation, timely and effective implementation of policies, integrity of the public sector and free negotiation of lawyers’ fees (as opposed to regulation) could all be important instruments for reducing litigation. 9. in many countries there is also scope for reducing appeal rates, a simple measure of the predictability of court decisions. appeal rates are lower in countries where filing an appeal is subject to obtaining permission (leave). however, as restrictions to appeal imposed by law do not explain all cross-country differences in appeal rates, there would seem to be scope for increasing predictability of court decisions (leading to lower appeal rates) without tightening restrictions.

852@Chile should continue strengthening growth and well-being, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/chileshouldcontinuestrengtheninggrowthandwell-beingsaysoecd.htm@"23/10/2013 - sound macroeconomic policies and the commodity boom have helped chile record an enviable period of economic growth and job creation. further reforms are needed to make the labour market more inclusive and growth greener, while more could be done to support innovation and entrepreneurship, according to the latest oecd economic survey of chile.the new survey, presented in santiago by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and chile’s finance minister felipe larraín, forecasts that the chilean economy will grow by 4.2% in 2013 and 4.5% in 2014. the oecd remains optimistic on public finances, the banking system, external transactions and inflation remaining in check. per capita income has crossed the threshold of $20,000, which is the highest in latin america. “chile has made terrific gains since it joined the oecd,” mr gurría said. “its commitment to open trade and investment regimes, bringing it together with other major economies in the region via the ‘pacific alliance,’ is welcome. this commitment, along with sound public policies, will continue to support chile’s economic convergence with the oecd average gdp,” mr gurría said. “the challenge going forward is to ensure that the tremendous economic performance is shared among all chileans. (read the full speech)""the survey says that making labour markets more inclusive would be a key step. while recent reforms and strong growth have helped more women and young people enter the labour force, their participation rates remain low when compared to most oecd and latin american countries. changing attitudes toward women’s work and parenting roles, as well as greater provision of childcare, could reduce barriers to female employment, for the benefit of the economy as a whole.better public employment services and training systems would help young people and low-skilled workers find jobs. extending a reduced minimum wage for youth to cover young people under 25 years of age, rather than just those under 18, would also help them get their first footholds in the workplace. better overall education, particularly in the early stages of compulsory schooling, should remain a priority.chile can create jobs and foster growth by further boosting entrepreneurship and innovation, the survey says. increasing r&d investment would require higher numbers of science and technology graduates, as would improvements to government innovation programmes. chilean policies to promote business angel investment and venture capital are seen as the best in latin america, and offer a clear indicator that the country is open to foreign entrepreneurs. the oecd survey points to chile’s large environmental footprint, with particular concerns regarding air quality and water availability. outside hydropower, the use of renewable energy sources is limited, and energy needs are largely met by imported fossil fuels.chile’s green growth strategy should continue to reduce the cost to society of pollution and excessive resource use, notably with environmental taxes and other pricing mechanisms. this will abate emissions, as will the promotion of green innovation and new clean technologies. there is scope for the mining sector to continue reducing its large amounts of local emissions and soil contamination.read the report, oecd economic survey of chile, online, share, link or embed on your website.media requests should be directed to the oecd’s media division (tel. +33 1 4524 9700)."
853@Innovation: Support for young firms would boost job creation, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/innovation-support-for-young-firms-would-boost-job-creation.htm@23/10/2013 - young firms play a crucial role in job creation. improving product, labour and capital markets and bankruptcy laws would help them foster employment growth and support the economic recovery, according to a new oecd report.the science, technology and industry scoreboard 2013 says that young firms (5 years old or less) accounted for only about 20% of non-financial business sector employment over the past decade, but generated nearly half of all new jobs.during the crisis, most of the jobs destroyed were the result of old businesses downsizing while net job growth in young firms remained positive.“giving dynamic, young firms, like startups, a better chance to succeed will create jobs and boost growth,” said andrew wyckoff, oecd director of science, technology and industry at the launch of the report in istanbul. “this new evidence highlights how important young firms are in many countries. policy makers need to rethink their approach to reforms to help young firms thrive and not overly favour large incumbents who sometimes crowd out these start-ups.”reforming bankruptcy laws in particular would benefit young firms to spur innovation: reducing the stringency of legislation from the highest to the average level in the oecd, for example, could raise capital flows to patenting firms by around 35%.young firms are playing an increasingly important role in patenting: over a sample of sixteen economies, young firms represented 24% of all patenting firms and applied on average for 12% of patents.the report reveals recent changes in the mix of jobs in europe. for example, demand for lower-skilled jobs, such as machine operators and clerical support staff, fell by around 7% each in 2011 and 2012, and by around 20% for managers. but job opportunities for the high-skilled continued to rise, by around 13% for technicians and 50% for professionals.the share of jobs in the service sector continued to rise in the crisis, making up about 74% of all jobs in oecd countries.governments should do more to help knowledge-intensive service sector firms thrive and give workers the skills these industries need. information and technology skills should be emphasised in compulsory education and in training programmes for older workers, says the oecd.the scoreboard tracks trends in science, technology and industry to understand how innovation is evolving and how countries are positioning themselves in the global knowledge economy. it includes more than 260 internationally comparable quality indicators and provides a broad range of statistics for other major economies such as brazil, china, india, and the russian federation.the complete scoreboard 2013 is available at www.oecd.org/sti/scoreboard.htm. the charts and underlying data are available for download and for the first time, selected indicators contain additional data expanding the time and country coverage of the print edition.the report is available for journalists from the password protected website. for more information, the journalists should contact the oecd's media relations division.for more information, journalists should contact martine zaïda of the oecd’s directorate for science, technology and industry (tel. + 33 1 45 24 19 19).
854@Brazilian economy is expanding again but long-term challenges remain, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/brazilian-economy-is-expanding-again-but-long-term-challenges-remain.htm@"22/10/2013 - brazil has moved up the ranks of the world’s largest economies while making economic growth ever more inclusive. renewed economic dynamism will allow it to continue converging with more advanced economies and ensuring that disadvantaged groups share in the benefits of future growth, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of brazil.the report, presented today in brasília, points to areas where brazil can build on past achievements and pave the way for stronger growth in the years to come.“brazil is reaping the benefits of years of reforms that have delivered greater economic prosperity and a fairer distribution of the benefits of growth among the population,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said. “growth and sensible policies have allowed 40 million people to join the middle class over the last decade. now the challenge is to create the conditions that will allow further improvements to living standards and sustained reductions in income inequality in a sound macroeconomic environment.” (read the speech) brazil’s success has been built on solid fiscal and monetary policy frameworks. to consolidate these achievements, the oecd says it is important that brazil build on its hard-won reputation by managing the public finances in a clear, predictable and transparent manner. brazil should also continue to tighten monetary policy as required to bring inflation back to the 4.5% target.boosting productivity and the competitiveness of brazilian firms will increase the size of the economic pie, the survey says. to do so, brazil should move forward on much-needed structural reforms, not least to improve infrastructure and the business environment, streamline a burdensome tax system, and open up trade and investment opportunities to provide a level regulatory playing field.to ensure that the fruits of growth are shared by all brazilians, the oecd says brazil should continue to put education and skills at the centre of the fight against inequality and poverty. scaling up early childhood education, improving the quality of teaching, reducing the number of drop-outs and expanding vocational training can do much to improve the quality of education.social policies have also played a key role in reducing poverty and reducing income disparities. brazil can focus more on programmes that have proven most effective to improve the living conditions of poor people, including through targeted income support, such as bolsa família. improving access and the quality of public services, such as health care and urban transportation, will also have widespread benefits.the survey congratulates brazil on its substantial progress in improving the sustainable use of natural resources. deforestation has slowed, but large areas of forest are still being destroyed. strictly enforcing the new forest code will be central to further success in this area.brazil’s substantial use of renewable energy sources - notably water power and ethanol - has contributed to a reduction in carbon emissions. to make further progress in this area, domestic fuel prices need to be set in a manner that does not undermine the use of renewable energy sources and is consistent with further reduction in emissions.read the report, oecd economic survey of brazil, online, share, link or embed on your website.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."
855@Innovation, diversification and better logistics key to sustainable and inclusive growth, says latest Latin American Economic Outlook@http://www.oecd.org/economy/innovation-diversification-and-better-logistics-key-to-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth-in-latin-america.htm@"18/10/2013 - after a decade of relatively strong growth, latin america is facing headwinds associated with declining trade, a moderation in commodity prices and increasing uncertainty over external financial conditions, according to the latest latin american economic outlook jointly produced by the oecd development centre, the un economic commission for latin america and the caribbean (un eclac) and caf - development bank of latin america.the report was released in panama city during the xxiii ibero-american summit. weak economic performance in the euro area, the slowdown in some emerging economies and uncertainty over u.s. monetary and fiscal policy are also weighing on latin america’s weaker outlook. “latin america can still achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, but the window is narrowing,” said oecd secretary general angel gurría. “to meet the new challenges and opportunities posed by an increasingly interconnected global economy, countries across the region need to boost competitiveness, through economic diversification, improved logistics performance and a move up the value chain towards higher value-added activities,” mr gurría said (read the full speech in spanish).alicia bárcena, eclac executive secretary said: “it is necessary to adopt reforms to enhance productivity and reinforce the capacity of governments to respond to the demands of an ‘emerging middle class,’ while redoubling their efforts to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality.”the latin american economic outlook says technological innovation and economic diversification will be key to boosting productivity and potential growth, which remain low when compared to other regions. latin america’s contribution to global gdp growth has remained virtually unchanged (i.e., between 7% and 9%) since the early-1990s, while that of emerging asia has more than doubled in the same period.many latin america economies remain heavily focused on natural resources – commodities make up 60% of the region’s goods exports, up from 40% at the beginning to the last decade.the report presented today encourages countries to use their natural wealth as a foundation for transitioning to production processes that use technology and knowledge. it also advocates that latin american economies diversify exports, particularly toward the services sector, which offers greater opportunities over the medium and long-term future. deepening the regional market would offer additional room for the services sector to grow and diversification to flourish.“further investment in transport infrastructure, and better logistics performance in general, is needed.” said enrique garcía, president and chief executive officer of caf. “latin america’s production structure is more sensitive to logistics than that of the oecd countries. the share of time-sensitive exports in latin america is three times that of the oecd countries, which underlines the importance of improving logistics to strengthen overall economic performance”, mr garcía, added.transport infrastructure remains deficient, with an urgent need for investment in roads, railways, ports and airports. investing 5.2% of regional gdp per year in infrastructure projects would help latin america close the infrastructure gap with other emerging regions and could increase gdp growth by an estimated 2 percentage points per year. much can also be done in the short term to improve the transport of goods and services using existing infrastructure, through integrated logistics policies, modern storage facilities, efficient customs and certification procedures, and promoting competition in transport.for further information, please contact:• for more information on the latin american economic outlook, visit: www.latameconomy.org• read online the full edition of the latin american economic outlook• to obtain a copy of the economic outlook, journalists are invited to contact the oecd development centre (dev.media@oecd.org;

856@Policies for inclusive urbanisation in China@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k3xz6hc2z0x-en@urbanisation in china has long been held back by various restrictions on land and internal migration but has taken off since the 1990s, as these impediments started to be gradually relaxed. people have moved in large numbers to richer cities, where productivity is higher and has increased further thanks to agglomeration effects. in the process, the rural-urban income differential has narrowed. urbanisation also entails costs, however, notably in the form of congestion, all the more so as public transport provision has not kept up. demand for living space is set to continue to increase as living standards improve, putting pressure on land prices. this can be offset by relaxing the very stringent restrictions on the use of agricultural land for building. for migrants to better integrate in the cities where they work, their access and that of their families to education, health and other social services must continue to improve, in particular via further changes to the registration system, coupled with more market-based rules on land ownership and use.r23: urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics / household analysis / urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics: regional migration;

857@Shaping the post-crisis global economy@http://www.oecd.org/economy/shaping-the-post-crisis-global-economy.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the islamic development bank10 october 2013, 13h00, washington, dc, united statespresident, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,it is a pleasure to be among you here today and to discuss some of the ways in which we can begin to shape the post-crisis global economy.the economic outlook: some bright spots, but we are not out of the woods yet!five years after the bankruptcy of lehman brothers, we are seeing some encouraging signs. activity is gaining momentum in north america and japan, and the situation in the euro area is improving. however, there remain a large number of serious risks that will need to be mitigated and challenges that will need to be addressed to put the global economy on a path of sustained recovery. we are not out of the woods yet!we know the risks well: continued vulnerability of the euro area to renewed financial, banking and sovereign debt tensions; exceptionally high public debt in japan; deadlock and brinkmanship over fiscal policy here in the us. a new and potentially worrying risk to the global outlook is that growth has also slowed in several major emerging-market economies.the bottom-line is that we cannot afford to lose momentum for reform! several countries have taken the opportunity of the post-crisis slowdown to put in place policies that can support growth and create jobs. this is especially the case of the peripheral euro area countries that have been facing market pressure because of their weak public finances.but at the oecd we believe all countries – not only those in difficulty -- need to go still further. there is always more that can be done to improve economic performance, even in countries that have being doing well.there are three corner-stones to building a strong recovery and a new era of inclusive growth: jobs, equality and trust. these are the “missing factors” following the crisis, and we want to help countries bring them back.unemployment risks leaving a permanent scar on our societies. there are close to 200 million people unemployed around the world. in the oecd area alone close to 49 million people are unemployed. the jobless rate is at 52% in south africa, close to 17% in tunisia and 13.5% in egypt.the young have been particularly hard hit. youth unemployment has risen to around 40% in italy and portugal, 55% in spain, and exceeds 60% in greece. in the mena region youth unemployment rates are typically more than double the average rate of joblessness. in addition to unemployment itself, dealing with low-paid employment in insecure jobs with little social protection remains a key challenge in many emerging and developing economies.of course, labour markets cannot be revived without sustained growth. but they must also be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms and specific actions to build more inclusive labour markets.for example, to bring people back to work, more active labour market policies are essential. as shown in our latest employment outlook and recent advice to the g20, such activation policies have to be tailored to the various obstacles different groups, such as the young, women, migrants, the disabled and older workers, face in gaining access to rewarding and productive employment.  to tackle labour market informality, further extensions of social safety nets combined with stronger incentives for employers to fully and transparently disclose their employees are required. overly strict employment protection that likely contributes to making employers reluctant to formalise employment relations also needs to be reconsidered.to help youth get off to a better start in their careers, the oecd has also developed an action plan for youth. this includes concrete policy measures that combine short-term measures to boost job creation for youth with more in‑depth reforms to enhance access to jobs, improve education outcomes and strengthen the compatibility between the skills acquired by students and those needed in the work place.  inequalities have also been rising.as we document in our study “divided we stand”, during the three decades prior to the recent economic downturn, wage gaps widened and income inequality increased in a large majority of oecd countries. and the crisis has, unfortunately, further widened these disparities. according to oecd analysis, inequality increased more over the three worst years of the crisis, from 2007 to 2010, than during the previous twelve. by 2011, the average income of the richest 10% of the population in oecd countries was about nine times that of the poorest 10%: that’s a ratio of 9 to 1!inequality is no less of a concern in emerging-market and developing countries. countries like china, india, the russian federation and south africa have all become less equal over the past 20 years. what is clear is that the benefits of economic growth are not trickling down. and while brazil has managed to reduce its disparities, the inequalities ratio in this country is still 50 to 1.the oecd is seeking to address the challenge of inequality in many areas of its work. but perhaps one of the most effective ways of addressing inequalities is through better education and skills development. earlier this week in brussels, i presented the results of our new survey of adult skills. this is a first-of-its-kind tool that assesses the depth and breadth of countries’ talent pools, how well countries use their talent and what benefits they gain.the survey confirms that inequality in skills is associated with inequality in income. the numbers speak for themselves: on average across countries, the median hourly wage of workers who get high scores in our literacy test  level 4 or 5, meaning that they can make complex inferences and evaluate subtle arguments in written texts  is more than 60% higher than the hourly wage of workers who score at level 1 or below  meaning those who can, at best, read relatively short texts and understand basic vocabulary. those with poor literacy skills are also more than twice as likely to be unemployed.let’s be clear: poor skills severely limit the access of people to basic services and to better paying and more rewarding jobs. this calls for action! at the oecd we are working with countries using the oecd skills strategy, adapting it to their national context, and helping them design educations and skills policies that will provide people with the skills they need to thrive in the 21st century global jobs market.a myriad of studies and opinion polls reveal a systemic loss of trust in politicians, ceos, governments, banks, corporations and markets throughout the world.one of the most worrying signals is the record low levels of trust in the government’s capacity to improve the situation: the 2013 edelman trust barometer, reports that only 15% of the people surveyed trust that government leaders “can solve social or societal issues”, while only 14% trust that these leaders can “make ethical and moral decisions”.what our nations need is a national strategy for trust! at the oecd we believe this is possible and urgent. and we recommend that any such strategy for trust should be built on three strong pillars: integrity, transparency and engagement.• integrity means firmly tackling corruption. at the oecd, we help countries to strengthen trust in the policy making process by turning knowledge into guidelines and principles for best practice in high-risk areas. these include for instance, public procurement, which accounts for 13% of gdp on average in oecd countries. it also includes lobbying: spending on this more than doubled over the past 15 years, increasing from usd 1.44 billion to usd 3.30 billion.• transparency is crucial across so many domains, including budgets and taxation. tax transparency is particularly important. our societies want to feel that they are paying a “fair share” of the tax bill. for example, multinational enterprises (mnes) are getting out of paying what they owe by shifting profits to locations with favourable tax treatment. base erosion and profit shifting (beps) constitutes a serious risk to tax fairness, tax sovereignty and tax revenues for countries around the globe. the oecd is partnering with the g20 to lead the charge on tackling beps through the oecd/g20 beps action plan, which puts forth 15 ambitious actions that should result in fundamental changes to international tax rules.• engagement is about giving citizens a voice in the policy process and ensuring that public services are well adapted to people’s needs. the oecd observatory of public sector innovation is gathering examples of good practice from across the globe to support governments in identifying innovative ways to deliver public services and reach out to communities. australia, for example, has launched the next step online community to better assist parents going back to work after years out of the workforce.there is no simple remedy for fixing the post-crisis global economy. there is no doubt that the full range of macroeconomic and structural policies is required. but three key ingredients for sustainable long-term growth are jobs, equality and trust. and we need to work together to achieve progress in these areas: through regional and bilateral initiatives, through the international organisations and through the likes of the g20.i am proud to say that we are already working closely with the idb and a number of idb member countries. we are working with indonesia through a jointly signed framework of co-operation. we are increasing our cooperation with malaysia, bilaterally and through our southeast asia regional programme. we are accompanying a number of mena countries (tunisia, libya, egypt, yemen, morocco and jordan) along their challenging reform process through the oecd-mena initiative on governance and investment for development and support to the g8 deauville partnership in areas such as investment, sme policies, open government and youth employment.if you take one message away from this lunch, let it be this: the oecd stands ready to support you in shaping the post-crisis global economy to deliver “better polices for better lives”.finally, let me take this opportunity to congratulate you, dear dr. ali, and your team for your excellent work as the 2013 chair of the deauville partnership international financial institutions coordination platform! we look forward to continuing our fruitful cooperation in the years to come.
858@Countries should make carbon pricing the cornerstone of climate policy, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/countries-should-make-carbon-pricing-the-cornerstone-of-climate-policy-says-oecd.htm@09/10/2013 - credible and consistent carbon pricing must be the cornerstone of government actions to tackle climate change, according to a new oecd report.releasing the report climate and carbon: aligning prices and policies during a lecture organised jointly with the london school of economics, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said that a transformation of the global energy system is needed if countries hope to limit climate change to a 2ºc temperature increase from pre-industrial levels, as agreed by the global community. he called for a coherent approach to carbon pricing, to ensure that price signals sent to consumers, producers and investors alike are consistent and facilitate the gradual phase-out of fossil fuel emissions. he also questioned how much impact existing climate policies can have when countries around the world continue to subsidise the exploration, production and use of fossil fuels. read mr. gurría’s speech on the climate challenge: achieving zero emissions.“whatever policy mix we put in place, it has to lead to the complete elimination of emissions to the atmosphere from fossil fuels in the second half of the century,” mr gurría said. “we don’t need to see zero net emissions tomorrow, but we will need to be on the pathway.”the report says governments need to ensure that carbon pricing is sufficient to achieve climate goals and that other policies are well-aligned with these goals. with international negotiations getting under way for a new climate agreement in 2015, every government needs to review its policy settings and rigorously assess if their overall impact helps climate action or hinders it.“cherry-picking a few easy policy measures is not enough,” mr gurría said. “there has to be progress on every front, but notably with respect to carbon pricing, and we don’t have any time to waste. unlike the financial crisis, we do not have a ‘climate bailout’ option up our sleeves.”the oecd report says that extending and improving the use of carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes is a necessary first step. governments also need to reform the estimated usd 55-90 billion of support provided each year to fossil fuel exploration, production and consumption in oecd countries[1] and the usd 523 billion in fuel and energy subsidies in developing countries[2]. while subsidies for consumers are often put in place for social reasons, they are usually poorly targeted, expensive and ultimately undermine climate policy action as well.the oecd identifies key elements for developing credible, stable and sustainable carbon pricing mechanisms that can underpin investments in new technologies, as well as in the infrastructure needed to achieve a zero net emission future. among the measures analysed are policy instruments that price every tonne of co2 emitted, and other policies that put an implicit price on emissions and cost-effectively spur innovation. the resulting policy package should increase incentives for consumers, producers and investors alike into making energy-efficient choices consistent with a zero carbon trajectory.read a copy of: climate and carbon: aligning prices and policies.for additional information journalists should contact the oecd media division or call: +33 45 24 97 00.further information on oecd climate change policy analysis is available at: http://www.oecd.org/environment/climate-carbon.htm.
859@Fiscal devaluation – can it help to boost competitiveness?@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/fiscal-devaluation-can-it-help-to-boost-competitiveness_5k3z2dckn2bw-en@the recent crisis has revealed large differences in external competitiveness between euro area member countries. since nominal exchange rate devaluation is not an option for members of a currency area, governments in troubled member countries have been considering so-called fiscal devaluation, i.e. a shift from employers’ social security contribution to value added tax, as an alternative means to restore competitiveness. this paper discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a reform and investigates under which circumstances it would have the intended effects. it argues that a fiscal devaluation can have transitory effects, but that any permanent real effects are likely to be small in size. the policy tool can thus not be a substitute for deeper structural reforms of labour, product and financial markets. however, it may be helpful as part of a broader package of reforms.
860@How to achieve growth- and equity-friendly fiscal consolidation?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k407lwvzkkh-en@how to achieve growth- and equity-friendly fiscal consolidation? a proposed methodology for instrument choice with an illustrative application to oecd countriesdespite sustained efforts made in recent years to rein in budget deficits, a majority of oecd countries still face substantial fiscal consolidation needs. the choices made about which spending areas to curtail and which taxes to hike will have implications for near-term activity and long-term growth as well as for equity and the current account. this paper proposes a method for choosing the instruments of consolidation so that they contribute to -- or minimise trade-offs with -- the goals of promoting near-term activity, longterm growth, equity, and global rebalancing. the proposed method is illustrated with detailed simulations for 31 oecd countries which are accompanied by an extensive range of alternative scenarios to confirm the robustness of the findings. the simulations highlight that half of oecd countries can reduce excess debt mainly through moderate adjustments to instruments (such as subsidies, pensions or property taxes) that have at most limited side-effects on other policy objectives. they also show that a smaller number of countries face more difficult choices, having to either make bigger adjustments in areas where spending cuts or tax hikes are least harmful or to rely significantly on consolidation instruments with substantial adverse side-effects. these trade-offs can to a large extent be alleviated through structural reforms in the delivery of public services and in taxation.h68: public economics / national budget, deficit, and debt / forecasts of budgets, deficits, and debt; h63: public economics / national budget, deficit, and debt / debt; debt management; sovereign debt; h62: public economics / national budget, deficit, and debt / deficit; surplus
861@Improving school-to-work transitions in New Zealand@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k40d6b633hl-en@the nz labour market is among the most flexible in the oecd, and outcomes for its young people have been among the best. however, labour-market opportunities are heavily determined by initial education, where new zealand’s system is also successful and innovative in many ways. average pisa results are among the oecd’s highest, but the dispersion of performance is also high, indicating a sizable group of underachievers. those in disadvantaged groups tend to have poor scholastic outcomes. these initial educational handicaps show up in higher drop-out rates and youth joblessness, greatly limiting these youths’ future life chances. indeed, intergenerational persistence in educational and employment outcomes appears very high. from both a social and economic point of view, it will be essential to develop more fully the human capital of the fast growing demographic group of ethnic minorities. better teaching quality is needed, with more attention devoted to diversity of student needs and learning approaches to keep children in school. a related problem is the apparently large divergence between the nature of skills supplied by the education sector and the skills demanded by employers. a greater role for youth apprenticeships could help to raise skill levels while aligning them better to the economy’s needs. all this has an important bearing on the government’s ambition to secure strong and sustainable growth with rising living standards and equal opportunities for all. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of new zealand (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/new-zealand-2maori013.htm).

more inclusive growth that promotes job creation and social equity by harnessing the power of entrepreneurship and innovation.”while the unemployment rate recently began to decline, joblessness remains a serious concern, according to the report. more than 13% of the labour force remains unemployed, with more than 60% out of work for more than 12 months, among the highest rates in the oecd.young people have been especially hard hit by the jobs crisis. the youth unemployment rate is 28.6%, while the number of young people emigrating continues to mount. at 11.3%, ireland has the oecd’s third-largest share of 15 to 19 year olds who are neither employed nor in education or training (neets), only turkey and italy. the oecd is working closely with the department of social protection to design a national action plan to implement the youth guarantee in ireland, agreed at eu level under the country’s recent eu council presidency. initiatives like this will be crucial to tackling youth unemployment in ireland.the oecd recommends that ireland do much more to assist the unemployed, notably long-term job-seekers. it points out a critical need for support and retraining, to ward against social exclusion and ensure that young people are prepared to work as the recovery strengthens. the local job creation report lays out new strategies to ensure that education and training programmes provide the skills needed in the labour markets of today and the future.the survey lays out a wide-ranging strategy for boosting growth. adherence to the government’s current budget strategy should soon put the debt-to-gdp ratio – now approaching a turning point above 120% – on a sustained downward path, supporting confidence and maintaining affordable access to financial markets. ireland should stay the course on this front.fiscal adjustment should focus on social equity and environmental protection. further pension reforms and reductions in tax expenditures could lower distortions to growth and improve equity. exports remain the main drivers of growth, but a gradual recovery of domestic demand is expected. overall, the economy is well poised to benefit from a pick-up in activity of its main trading partners.ireland should seek to build on past success in attracting innovative high-tech multinational companies. improvements to the business environment would help spread innovation and dynamism to the domestic sme sector. barriers to entrepreneurship are relatively high in some areas. licence and permit regulations could be made less restrictive by lowering costs and reducing waiting times. improving access to finance for smes will be a key challenge.government policies that have helped attract large global firms that create jobs and promote dynamism could be tailored to help smaller domestic companies. among its recommendations to boost innovation, the survey recommends consolidating the 170 budget lines and 11 major funding agencies into two groups – one dealing with science and basic research, and another with applied research and innovation. it also recommends better aligning higher education with innovative companies, lowering costs for small cap initial public offerings, and centralising legal processes for transferring intellectual property rights.given that ireland’s co emissions, waste generation and use of fertilizers are among the highest in the oecd, the report also suggests that taxes and user fees be used to help the country transition to a greener model of economic growth.further information on the economic survey of ireland is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/ireland-2013.htm. you are invited to include this link in reports on the survey.further information on local job creation: how employment

864@G20 Leaders’ Summit: Growth and Global Economy@http://www.oecd.org/economy/g20-leaders-summit-growth-and-global-economy.htm@the emphasis that the russian presidency has placed on returning to appropriate levels of growth demands an acceleration of the structural reform agenda in all g20 countries. it involves a gradual normalization of the policy stance in advanced economies, while keeping in mind the spill-over effects; it has to address the still unacceptably high levels of unemployment and the growing inequalities; it will require continuous commitment by g20 members to keep markets open for trade and investment and for us to complete the repair of the financial sector. the other challenge we have to address is the loss of trust by our societies in the capacity of governments to address their concerns.this is where the tax agenda of the g20 kicks in as one of the most meaningful deliverables of the group:• taxation lies at the heart of the social contract and constitutes a powerful instrument to reduce inequalities.• the measures you take to fight tax evasion and tax erosion, will provide the necessary resources to finance growth enhancing public investment, restore the health of public finances and promote job creation.• ensuring that wealthy individuals pay their fair share of tax, and preventing double non-taxation of multinational enterprises will help to restore public trust in governments.until 2009, it was impossible to obtain tax information from jurisdictions that had bank secrecy. four years later, 120 jurisdictions are working together in the context of the global forum on tax transparency to make it possible. over 1100 agreements to exchange tax information are now in place, delivering revenues.moreover, with your collective leadership and support, we are now preparing to migrate towards a new, more ambitious, single global standard: automatic exchange of tax information. 56 countries, including all g20 members, have already signed the convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters, to move towards automatic exchange of tax information.the other great task that you are undertaking is a far-reaching overhaul of international tax rules: the latter have not kept pace with the changing business environment, including the growing importance of intangibles and the digital economy. as you said, president putin: “the g20 action plan on base erosion and profit shifting (beps), developed with the support of the oecd, can be considered the most prominent step towards modernization and coordination of our countries’ tax policies in a hundred years.”i am happy to inform you that all g20 countries have signed on to beps and are now members of the g20/oecd beps project.we are looking at ways to close loopholes in international tax rules that allow companies to artificially shift profits away from the countries in which they are generated. we are even considering the development of a new multilateral instrument to amend the existing network of more than 4000 bilateral tax treaties, so that we do not have to renegotiate them one by one.the stakes for developing countries are just as high. they need support to mobilise their domestic resources. thus, our initiative of “tax.” their participation will be critical to the success of our initiative, as will our cooperation with the un, the imf and the world bank.we can build an international tax system that is transparent, efficient and fair, that serves our economies, our governments and our citizens. the oecd is honoured to serve you in this endeavour.thank you!
865@Advanced economies growing again but some emerging economies slowing, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/advanced-economies-growing-again-but-some-emerging-economies-slowing.htm@"3/9/2013 - a moderate recovery is underway in the major advanced economies, according to the oecd’s latest interim economic assessment. growth is proceeding at encouraging rates in north america, japan and the uk. the euro area as a whole is out of recession, although output remains weak in a number of countries.growth has slowed in some of the large emerging economies, however. one factor has been a rise in global bond yields – triggered in part by an expected scaling back of the us federal reserve’s quantitative easing – which has fuelled market instability and capital outflows in a number of major emerging economies, such as india and indonesia.since they now account for a large share of the world economy, the slowdown in the emerging economies points to sluggish near-term growth globally, despite the pick-up in the advanced economies.economic growth in the major advanced economies is expected to continue at a similar pace in the second half of 2013 as in the second quarter. in the three largest oecd economies, the us, japan and germany, activity is expected to expand by about 2 ½ per cent annualised in the third andfourth quarters. france is forecast to grow by about 1½ per cent annualised in the second half of the year, while in italy growth is expected to remain mildly negative. gdp growth in china is forecast to pick up to about 8% by the final quarter, after a slowdown in the first half of 2013. even that would represent a slower rate than in recent years, however.presenting the assessment in paris, oecd deputy chief economist jorgen elmeskov said: “the gradual pick-up in momentum in the advanced economies is encouraging but a sustainable recovery is not yet firmly established. major risks remain. the euro area is still vulnerable to renewed financial markets, banking and sovereign debt tensions. high levels of debt in some emerging markets have increased their vulnerability to financial shocks. and a renewal of brinksmanship over fiscal policy in the us could weaken confidence and trigger new episodes of financial turmoil. ”he added: “continued support for demand is still needed to make sure recovery takes hold, and it remains vital that this be complemented by structural reforms to boost growth, rebalance the global economy and avoid a ratcheting-up of structural unemployment.”tackling high unemployment is crucial and must be a key focus of government action, says the oecd. unemployment rates are around 12 per cent in the euro area and 7½ per cent in the united states, far above pre-crisis levels, and to avoid high rates getting entrenched even as a recovery takes hold governments must implement effective training and activation policies, backed by support for stronger demand. reforming tax-benefit systems should improve work incentives while targeted measures are needed for vulnerable groups such as jobless young people outside the training and education system.the interim economic assessment says public finances have been improving in most advanced economies, with the exception of japan, but that fiscal consolidation policies must continue. such policies need to be better designed, however, to protect the most vulnerable in society, to build public support for necessary structural reforms and to prioritise spending to help get people back to work.for further information, journalists should contact the oecd media office (news.contact@oecd.org; +33 1 45 24 97 00)watch the video on the interim economic assessment with deputy secretary-general and chief economist, pier carlo padon, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l307muzdsho"

Exploring the empirical evidence: 1995–2010@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k422105ht33-en@this paper analyses convergence in per capita gross regional product of russia’s regions during the period 1995-2010, when regional data are available. using a panel regression framework we find no evidence for beta-convergence. instead we find divergence, which is, however, attenuated over time. robustness checks that use regional real income instead of gross regional product confirm this outcome as do non-parametric estimates of convergence, namely estimates using markov transition probability matrices and stochastic kernel plots of regional relative income. decompositions of regional income and gross regional product also find no sigma-convergence of russian regions. these decompositions point to the geographical concentration of extractive activities in the urals and of business services and of the public administration in the moscow area as the main culprit for this lack of convergence. they also establish that despite reforms to equalize provisions of public goods across russia, the social services sector of the public administration, education and health still do not have the expected equalizing impact on regional income.
872@Responding to key well-being challenges in Austria@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k42210gg9g5-en@important challenges for the future of austrian well-being arise from demographic and environmental trends. the ageing of the population calls for a fair balance between life-time pension contributions and entitlements, drawing on the recent pension reform. such progress will allow austrians to make more informed choices between the length of their work and contribution periods and retirement length and income according to their preferences, without threatening fiscal sustainability. with female labour force participation rising, family policies should help reconcile equality of opportunity within families by promoting the availability, affordability and quality of support services. a growing share of immigrant groups with low human capital calls for remedial policies to preserve social cohesion. environmental pressures arise from urban sprawl and the strong expansion of road transport. turning around these trends will require more appropriate pricing of the externalities and better regional development policies to foster denser settlements that are well connected to public transport. this entails a need to strengthen coordination between different government layers and better integration of regional development with transport and housing policies. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of austria (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/austria-2013.htm).

874@Improving fiscal federal relations for a stronger Mexico@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k42213gqpr3-en@mexico has achieved a high degree of decentralisation in public services, but the mexican fiscal federal system has important shortcomings. states and municipalities have become heavily dependent on federal transfers to finance a growing share of public spending. this leaves the burden of raising tax revenues falling almost exclusively on the federal government and reduces incentives for efficient spending and active tax collection at the subnational level. it can also lead to moral hazard and fiscal slippages. the federal government should harden the budget constraint on sub-national governments by limiting further increases in transfers and avoiding extraordinary transfers. promoting the implementation of stronger fiscal rules, such as rules on deficits and debt ceilings, could also help to harden budget constraints and to ensure greater fiscal discipline. states should be given more taxing powers, if they are to collect a larger share of total revenues. greater accountability and clarification of spending responsibilities could also contribute to improve the efficiency of spending among states and municipalities.
875@Deleveraging: challenges, progress and policies@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4221459fjc-en@in the run-up to the financial crisis, indebtedness of households and non-financial businesses rose to historically high levels in many oecd countries; gross debt of financial companies rose dramatically relative to gdp. much of the debt accumulation appears to have been based on excessive risk-taking and exceptional macro-economic conditions and therefore not sustainable. since the start of the crisis, non-financial private sector debt has receded substantially in the united states and the united kingdom. other oecd countries have not experienced significant debt reduction but already achieved some adjustment in terms of private saving and investment (with the seeming contradiction between these two observations explained by the private sector accumulating gross financial assets at a faster pace). some macro-economic risks related to future household deleveraging nevertheless remain in a few oecd countries where indebtedness has risen in recent years. in the financial sector, possible future deleveraging will be more damaging to growth if it involves reducing assets rather than retaining (or raising) equity. to speed up the deleveraging process and minimising its impact on prosperity, bad loans should be recognised swiftly, losses taken, insolvent banks wound down orderly and capital shortfalls plugged at still solvent banks.

881@Fiscal consolidation across government levels. Part 3: Intergovernmental grants, pro- or counter-cyclical?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43nxqrlmtf-en@this paper provides empirical analysis that measures the cyclical properties of intergovernmental transfers (or grants). modelling a fiscal policy reaction function this paper tests whether the transfers systems in oecd countries are pro- or counter-cyclical, i.e. whether they offset cyclical fluctuations of sub-central economies or, on the contrary, exacerbate them. regression results suggest that transfer systems tend to be pro-cyclical in general and in more than half of oecd countries they tend to destabilise sub-central budgets. transfer pro-cyclicality may be the result of several factors: transfer spending is often determined as a share of central government tax revenue, which itself tends to fluctuate with the cycle. moreover, many grants are matching sub-central spending and hence tend to exacerbate fluctuations of that sub-central spending. pro-cyclical grants could partly explain the often observed pro-cyclicality of subcentral government fiscal policy.
882@Fiscal consolidation across government levels. Part 2: Fiscal rules for sub-central governments, update of the institutional indicator@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43nxqzhkr1-en@fiscal rules that constrain sub-central government (scg) budgeting are very common across the oecd, but there are substantial cross-country differences in their implementation and impact. this paper presents the 2011 update of the fiscal rules database established in 2005. as in 2005, budget balance objectives are the most common form of rule along with borrowing constraints, while limits on scg expenditure are rare. because of trade-offs between objectives that fiscal rules must cater to, cross-country variation in the value of the composite indicator is low. there is, however, much more variation in country scores for the individual objectives of fiscal rules. despite the increased focus on sustainability in public finances over recent years, indicator values have changed little since 2005 except for a few countries. this suggests that the sub-central fiscal rules framework was in place well before the recent crisis struck.
883@Fiscal consolidation across government levels. Part 1: How much, what policies?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43nxr99zd6-en@this paper provides an overview of fiscal consolidation efforts at the central and sub-central government level, both during the current and past consolidation episodes. after experiencing a deficit and debt hike during the crisis, sub-central debt is mostly stabilising. so far, sub-central consolidation has been mainly achieved through spending cuts, while overall revenues remained largely stable. sub-central tax revenues rose a bit, but intergovernmental transfers went down slightly. sub-central governments in a few countries need to consolidate further, if they want to reach debt levels of 2007 or 2011 by the year 2026, as shown by fiscal gap calculations. during past consolidation episodes, sub-central consolidation increased the probability of debt stabilisation at the general government level. reductions in intergovernmental grants improved the success rate. central and sub-central deficits tended to move in parallel, although some subcentral governments experienced a “second trough” three or four years after consolidation had started. the paper suggests a number of instruments that could help sub-central governments consolidate their budgets, and argues in favour of amendments to sub-central fiscal rules.
884@Restructuring the electricity sector and promoting green growth in Japan@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43nxrhfjtd-en@the 2011 disaster and nuclear problems opened the door to a new energy policy, as they raised fundamental questions about the electricity system’s ability to prevent and respond to accidents. in particular, the system has had difficulty coping with the shortages caused by the accident and the suspension of operations of nuclear power plants. addressing these problems requires creating a more competitive electricity sector by reducing the dominance of the ten regional monopolies through ownership unbundling of generation and transmission and by expanding the wholesale market. it is also important to increase interconnection capacity, while introducing real-time pricing. the reduced role of nuclear power following the fukushima accident makes it necessary to accelerate the expansion of renewable energy, which requires setting a sufficiently high and consistent price for carbon. finally, the government should ensure the independence of the new nuclear regulatory agency and create an independent regulator for the electricity sector to promote competition. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of japan (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/japan)
885@Labour market policies to promote growth and social cohesion in Korea@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43nxrmq8xx-en@labour market reform to improve growth prospects and reduce inequality is a top priority in the face of rapid population ageing and a dualistic labour market. sustaining output growth requires policies to mitigate the impact of rapid population ageing by increasing labour inputs from under-employed segments of the population. in particular, female labour participation should be encouraged by better work-life balance and increasing the availability of highquality, affordable childcare. more flexible employment and wage systems would increase the age at which older workers leave firms. for young people, improved vocational education at the secondary and tertiary levels would help overcome the labour mismatch and the overemphasis on tertiary education. labour market dualism creates serious equity concerns, as non-regular workers face significantly lower wages, precarious jobs, less coverage by social security and less training. a comprehensive approach is required to break down dualism, including reduced employment protection for regular workers, alongside improved social insurance coverage and expanded training for non-regular workers. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of korea (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/korea).
886@Choosing fiscal consolidation instruments compatible with growth and equity@http://www.oecd.org/economy/choosing-fiscal-consolidation-instruments.htm@this study proposes a structured approach to selecting instruments of fiscal consolidation that are consistent with growth, equity and global-rebalancing objectives, which is then illustrated with a particular application.in most oecd countries, compared with what had been achieved by end 2012, additional consolidation is needed in the short to medium term to put government debt on a trajectory toward more prudent levels (defined for simplicity as gross debt at 60% of gdp) and even more to keep debt stable in the very long run, i.e. in 2060.consolidation instruments (increases in particular taxes and cuts in specific spending areas) can be ranked according to their effects on short- and long-term growth, income distribution and current accounts, with the rankings taking into account country circumstances. based on these rankings, illustrative consolidation packages to optimise the side-effects of consolidation on other policy objectives can be drawn up for each country. the packages are based on using instruments sequentially, and within reasonable limits, starting from the most desirable and moving down the ranking until consolidation needs are satisfied. based on this approach, half of oecd countries appear to be in a position to fulfil their short- to medium-term consolidation needs entirely through instruments that are well ranked (that is to say ranked in the top half). this suggests that, in these countries, well-designed consolidation packages can avoid severe adverse side effects on growth, equity and current account imbalances.in the simulations, eight countries use some poorly-ranked instruments but achieve more than half their short- to medium-term consolidation through well-ranked instruments. in the illustrative simulations, three countries (japan, united kingdom and the united states) implement more than 50% of their short-to-medium-term consolidation packages through instruments that have low rankings meaning that they are likely to involve substantial adverse side-effects.despite the generally stronger consolidation requirements in the long term, twenty countries would manage to keep debt durably stable at 60% of gdp by relying only on well-ranked instruments. in the simulated very long-term packages, six countries use some poorly ranked instruments but can nonetheless achieve more than 50% of their adjustment with well-ranked instruments.a few countries would have to implement most of their simulated very long-term consolidation packages relying on poorly-ranked instruments (that have more adverse effects on long-term growth and equity objectives).
887@Education reform in Korea@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43nxs1t9vh-en@the rapid expansion of education in korea is exceptional and has played a key role in its economic development. sustaining korea’s growth potential in the face of demographic headwinds requires further improving the education system to boost productivity growth. one priority is to upgrade early childhood education and care (ecec). korea also needs to address the overemphasis on tertiary education, in part by improving vocational education, to reduce the mismatch problem that limits labour participation of youth. tertiary education needs restructuring to improve quality. in addition, the large share of private spending in education increases the impact of socio-economic factors on educational outcomes. education reforms are thus needed to promote inclusive growth, notably by: i) improving the access of low-income children to high-quality ecec; ii) reducing reliance on private tutoring, notably at hagwons, by improving university admission procedures, expanding the quality and diversity of schools and upgrading vocational education; and iii) expanding loans to university students with repayment contingent on income after graduation. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of korea (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/korea).

""austria has enjoyed a remarkable performance, even during the crisis, keeping unemployment low and gdp growing, but more than that austrians have achieved strong material well-being, low levels of inequality, high environmental standards and a high quality of life,” mr gurría said. “the challenge going forward is to manage the synergies and trade-offs between economic growth, well-being and the need to maintain healthy public finances, to ensure that future generations benefit from the same conditions afforded to austrians today,” mr. gurria said (read the speech in full.)particular attention will need to be paid to three areas that could undermine the strength of austria’s stable economy and thriving society:demographic developments, and notably the ageing of the population, may undermine the financial sustainability of the pension system. rising female participation in the labour force reinforces the need for making high-quality institutional child care available and affordable for the parents of children at all ages, to reconcile work and care responsibilities within families. the survey also finds that people from migrant backgrounds have not shared in well-being gains to the same extent as the average austrian. the lack of skills amongst immigrant groups calls for policies to improve the educational and labour market prospects of future generations.environmental pressures will arise from urban sprawl and expansion of road transportation, requiring new efforts to make polluters pay the cost of externalities. increasing diesel taxes, extending the road pricing system, abolishing the favourable taxation of company cars and phasing out the commuting subsidy should all be considered. better coordination across different layers of government and stronger integration of housing and transport policies will also be necessary.changes in the global economy will challenge austria’s strong place in international supply chains and notably its comparative advantages in medium technology activities. for austria to remain competitive, corporate governance in family firms should be modernised, to facilitate ownership changes between generations and the arrival of venture capital, and the service sector should be further open to competitive pressures. further education reforms will be necessary to meet the growing demand for workers with solid, generic skills, which are cultivated through life-long learning.austria can rely on its ability to build social consensus to successfully confront these challenges but it should also ensure that its unique social partnership system continue to evolve with the society and notably broadens to include vulnerable groups.further information on the economic survey of austria is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/austria-2013.htm. you are invited to include this internet link in reports on the survey.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd’s media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."

ageing"@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k44ssnfdnr7-en@belgium: enhancing the cost efficiency and flexibility of the health sector to adjust to population ageingbelgium has a good record in delivering accessible care, but adaptation to population ageing will be complicated by the fragmentation of responsibilities in the healthcare system and a strong reliance on government regulations. the organisation of the system could be rationalised by giving sickness funds a more active role as promoters of cost-efficiency, better aligning the incentives of the different levels of government and focussing on medium-term budgeting. at the level of care providers, better information flows and incentive structures could facilitate addressing practice and efficiency variations and supplier-induced demand. this notably involves completing the shift to pathology-based budgets in hospitals, more capitation in the remuneration of doctors and measures to tackle the high spending on drugs. once incentives for cost-efficiency are in place, a shift towards a more demand-driven system could be encouraged by phasing out over-prescriptive hospital regulations. in addition, relative remunerations of doctors should be revised regularly to ensure an adequate supply per specialty. in long-term care, home care, which is generally cost-efficient, could be further encouraged by giving more autonomy to patients to organise their care. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of belgium (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/belgium).i13: health, education, and welfare / health / health insurance, public and private; i11: health, education, and welfare / health / analysis of health care markets; i18: health, education, and welfare / health / health: government policy; regulation; public health; h51: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies / government expenditures and health

892@Greening growth in Luxembourg@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k44t7j62qg1-en@with strong economic growth overall and an increasingly important role as a regional economic centre, luxembourg is experiencing mounting environmental pressures. this is mainly a result of a growing population and a rapid increase in transport, which is dominated by the car, as the number of workers commuting within luxembourg and from across the border has risen rapidly. ensuing environmental pressures are sizable, including through co2 emissions, air pollution and land use changes. large-scale commuting, combined with low fuel taxes compared to neighbouring countries, has entailed rapid increases in greenhouse gas emissions, which are higher in luxembourg in per capita terms than almost anywhere else in the oecd. sound housing policies, urban and transport planning to limit urban sprawl and to promote public transport, and measures to better internalise environmental externalities will be needed to ensure that luxembourg’s economic growth is compatible with environmental and economic sustainability and the well-being of its population. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of luxembourg (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/luxembourg).
893@The post-crisis narrowing of international imbalances - cyclical or durable?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k44t7j9sdtc-en@after peaking in the first half of 2008, international imbalances declined sharply during the global crisis of 2008-09, in part reflecting cyclical factors such as large contractions in domestic demand on the back of bursting housing bubbles in a number of deficit countries, as well as large declines in cross-border capital flows, interest rates and commodity prices. this paper suggests that business and housing cycles alone account for around half of the decline in international imbalances, with real exchange rate and fiscal adjustments explaining only around one fifth. a range of stylised scenarios for the major trading areas that extends the short-term projections in oecd economic outlook no. 93 of may 2013 to 2020 suggests that in the absence of policy adjustments beyond 2014 international imbalances could rebound as output gaps gradually close and housing markets normalise, though to levels below the pre-crisis peak. ambitious fiscal adjustment in countries with the largest remaining fiscal imbalances and selected structural reforms could offset the cyclical rebound in international imbalances and prevent diverging net asset positions in most areas. moreover, ambitious fiscal and structural policy adjustments would provide some margin in case upside risks to international imbalances -- such as renewed housing booms that could be triggered by a rebound in cross-border capital flows or higher oil prices -- materialise.
894@Public spending on health and long-term care: a new set of projections@http://www.oecd.org/economy/public-spending-on-health-and-long-term-care.htm@• none differences in health and long-term care spending emerge across oecd countries partly reflecting differing demographic trends as well as initial levels of income and informal long-term care supply. korea, chile, turkey and mexico, for example, are projected to experience above average increases in public health expenditures. by contrast, the nordic countries, as well as the united states and the united kingdom, display lower than average growth over the next 50 years.‌‌• none the drivers of expenditure increases will differ between spending categories: health care spending will be pushed up mostly by the combined effect of technology, relative prices and exogenous factors (such as institutions and policies), while pressures on long-term care costs will originate mostly from weaker productivity gains than in the economy as a whole. under reasonable assumptions about improving health conditions of the elderly in ageing societies (the so-called “healthy ageing” hypothesis) and the response of health spending to rising incomes, pure demographics and income effects will play only a minor role in the projected increase of public health and long-term care expenditures.• none in all countries, both health and long-term care will be driving up public spending. focusing on the cost-containment scenario, for oecd countries average public health care expenditure is projected to increase from 5.5% of gdp in 2010 to 8% in 2060; whereas public long-term care expenditure is projected to increase from 0.8% to 1.6% of gdp in 2060. for the briics, average public health care expenditure is projected to increase from 2.4% of gdp in 2010 to more than 4% in 2060; while public long-term care expenditure is projected to increase from 0.1% to 0.9% of gdp in 2060.• none given the competing pressures from other social spending programmes, these projected trends in public health and long-term care spending are likely to be a major source of concern for most governments. upside risks related to extension of the typical pre-death period of ill health as longevity increases, higher than expected costs as technical progress makes it possible to meet new demands and increased dependency due to obesity trends or dementia suggest that the projected path of expenditures provides a lower bound in the absence of more ambitious cost containment policies.
895@Restructuring welfare spending in Slovenia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k44v50kwzxx-en@restoring fiscal sustainability is a major challenge in slovenia. yet, the performance in terms of expenditure control is poor and public expenditure on social spending increased briskly during the crisis, significantly more than on average across the oecd. despite recent progress in reforming the pension system, slovenia continues to face major age-related spending pressures. reforming the welfare state would help achieve fiscal consolidation, increase the quality of fiscal adjustment and address long-term fiscal sustainability challenges. this could be done without significantly worsening income inequality, which is low in slovenia. despite recent progress, cash transfers do not seem to be sufficiently means tested. partly driven by generous social transfers, average effective tax rates on returning to work from inactivity and unemployment are high and could be further cut gradually. efficiency frontier analysis suggests there is scope to improve spending efficiency without undermining the quality of in kind services on secondary education, health care and public administration. there is excess capacity in pre-school and compulsory education and the allocation of tertiary education services is regressive. the delivery of health care could be improved by rationalising inpatient care and enhancing costeffective primary care, which would generate savings in the medium term. further increasing the effective retirement age and reforming the financing of health and long-term care are the main policy priorities to contain the pressure of population ageing on expenditure. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic review of slovenia (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/slovenia-2013.htm).

903@New approach to globalisation and global value chains needed to boost growth and jobs, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/newapproachtoglobalisationandglobalvaluechainsneededtoboostgrowthandjobs.htm@28/05/2013 - technological advances, less costly shipping and trade liberalisation have transformed the way in which companies make products and distribute them worldwide. governments that become more open to trade and investment, and encourage innovation will help firms better integrate the global value chains that are driving growth in increasingly interconnected economies, according to new oecd research.the oecd, wto and unctad were asked to report to the g20 summit in st. petersburg in september 2013 on the rising impact of global value chains (gvcs). as part of this process, the oecd is hosting a g20 stocktaking seminar on global value chains, organized by the russian presidency, tomorrow wednesday 29 may, where the findings of its analysis on trade in value added (tiva) will be discussed, as well as the policy implications.interconnected economies: benefitting from global value chains discusses the challenges and opportunities facing advanced, emerging-market and developing economies as they seek to integrate into the global marketplace.“everyone can benefit from global value chains, but we will all benefit more if governments take steps to enhance the new business environment,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría at the oecd forum in paris. “it is essential to embrace freer trade and resist protectionism as countries seek out new investment, faster productivity enhancement and competitiveness. encouraging the development and participation in global value chains is the road to more jobs and sustainable growth for our economies.”the oecd report points out that the extent to which countries take part in gvcs varies widely. small open economies like the slovak republic or belgium rely heavily on foreign imports to make finished goods. large economies, like the united states and japan, are more active in upstream activities and produce intermediate goods that are included in the exports of countries further down the value chain (read the 40 country notes).services, such as information communications technology, transport and logistics, account for over half of all value creation in gvcs in many oecd countries and over 30% in china. upgrading the quantity of services and proceeding with its liberalisation would enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing firms and make it easier for them to take part in gvcs. openness to trade is also essential, as import tariffs effectively act as taxes on exports by firms that use imported components to manufacture goods for export. countries that stimulate investment in innovation and intellectual capital, such as design, r&d and new business models, will help their firms move up the value chain.another report to be discussed by ministers meeting at the oecd this week, new sources of growth: knowledge-based capital, finds wide differences between countries in the levels of such investment. knowledge-based capital includes computerised information (software and databases); innovative property (patents, copyrights, designs, trademarks); and economic competencies (including brand equity, firm-specific human capital, networks joining people and institutions, and organisational know-how that increases enterprise efficiency).the united states, japan and sweden, for example, invest around 10% of gdp in knowledge-based capital, compared to less than 5% in italy, portugal and spain. some are also more successful at helping innovative firms attract investment: firms that patent their ideas raise four times as much capital in sweden and the us than in italy and spain.well-functioning product, labour and risk capital markets are needed. strong intellectual property rights encourage innovation but the rising costs of litigation are undermining the effectiveness of the patent system in many countries, according to the report.tax incentives and loans or grants for r&d boost investment in intellectual capital but are often poorly designed, especially for young firms which are an increasingly important creator of new jobs: between 2001 and 2011, firms less than five years old provided 18% of all jobs in oecd countries studied but accounted for 47% of all new jobs created.oecd work on global value chains and related issues will also be discussed during the oecd forum – the first panel, “21st century production revolution”, starts at 10.30 am on tuesday.for comment or more information on the reports, journalists should contact koen de backer or alistair nolan of the oecd’s science technology and industry directorate or spencer wilson of the oecd media division.
904@Speech delivered to the OECD Council by the Prime Minister of Portugal, HE. Pedro Passos Coelho@http://www.oecd.org/economy/speechdeliveredtotheoecdcouncilbytheprimeministerofportugalhepedropassoscoelho.htm@"its publication coincides with the final stages of the closing of the 7th review of our adjustment program with the european union and the international monetary fund. we have worked very hard to bring the 7th review to a successful conclusion and now i believe that all conditions are met to reach this important milestone.but i would like to take this opportunity to offer my views on the challenges ahead. to a large extent, these challenges are common to other countries in the oecd although we always should keep in mind the vast array of national particularities.history provides us with many examples of societies which withstood, and dealt successfully with, terrible crises. it is important to learn lessons from them. societies which looked at their crises and saw them as a plea and as an opportunity for change were precisely those which were more successful in overcoming them. by change i mean structural, institutional change. that kind of change that adjusts economies, laws and institutions, to the new challenges brought by wider reality, and allows people to face new events, discoveries, and innovations, not as threats but as tools and opportunities. in a word, the kind of change that makes countries go forward on the path to progress. as you may have guessed by now this is what i have in mind when i use that oft-repeated expression ""structural reform"". now, that is the kind of reform, the kind of change that my country needed. and i should add that, in the last couple of years, this is the kind of change that we've finally had.these last 15 years in portugal have shown beyond any doubt that we needed to change. the status quo was eternalizing a very costly and painful stagnation in the economy. it was deepening social inequalities- as the oecd report states, in 2008 portugal was the most unequal country in europe. it was arresting social mobility. it was protecting a privileged few and leaving everyone else behind. it was widening poverty. together with a very rapid process of population ageing, it was threatening the sustainability of our welfare state, our public education and our public health care. and then came the international financial crisis which made these weaknesses all the more evident. the structural reform that we have advanced has been wide-ranging and should be seen as an articulated whole.- labour market reform, involving both the private and public sector;- product market reform, in the way of reducing rents in network and sheltered sectors, liberalization of the energy and gas market, and increasing competition throughout the economy:- judicial reform, to make the judicial system more adjusted to the needs of the economy and more open to citizens;- fiscal reform, with the objective of introducing more discipline, predictability and transparency;- the privatization program which raised a great amount of foreign investment and has brought the portuguese economy closer to the most dynamic regions in our contemporary world;and a wide-ranging set of reforms which have improved our business environment;these are just the more widely known aspects of our reformist approach.and i could still add profound changes that we have brought to the public health care system, public education, the urban lease market, the legal framework of insolvencies and corporate recovery, and the reduction of bureaucracy in general.let me now tell you why we embarked on this process of structural reform.we did it because we needed to close our competitiveness gap. here i am saying something you already know. this is the recommendation every international organization has been giving portugal. and it has been one of the most widely commented sides of our story. we are rapidly closing our competitiveness gap and we have all but closed the large external imbalances which have plagued us for too many years. portugal is now a net lender for the first time in two decades. for the first time in 60 years we had a positive balance of trade in goods and services.furthermore, since structural reform points towards the future, we did it because we want to boost our growth potential and start a new, sustainable cycle of prosperity. again, i am not saying anything very surprising to you.but there is a social and political aspect of structural reform that for me is absolutely crucial. something that is seldom mentioned as one of the main driving purposes at the heart of a general reform strategy. we embraced structural reform because we want a more inclusive kind of economic growth, we want a society of opportunities for all in which no one is left behind. that is why i have called this process of structural reform in my country ""the democratization of the economy"".we want to bring change, and we already have brought change, to our economic institutions. the economy must not, and should not, be a closed sphere of unjustified privilege. it should be a true level playing field for everyone. everyone has the right to participate in economic life and everyone should be properly equipped to participate in economic life. structural reform should therefore be at the service of this great design. this is a key element in the pursuit of social justice. if we think about it, it is also a key element of equality in any decent, modern society. access to, and participation in, economic life is a necessary condition for the pursuit of personal projects and life plans. it is a general condition for the pursuit of happiness in the modern world. it is the stuff real, sustainable social cohesion is made of.but it is not only a matter of justice. it is not only a matter of bringing home the promises of a social market economy. i believe that, in the final analysis, it is also the best way to increase efficiency and productivity throughout the economy. the democratization of the economy is one of the most effective, most durable, and deepest stimuli that we can bring to portuguese society.openness is a key word here. we are increasing our openness to the globalized world, making our economy more export-oriented and more successful in attracting foreign direct investment. but in order to generate real, concrete benefits for everyone we must understand that this kind of openness is not independent of a wider process of openness throughout the society. that is why we are opening up our economy and our institutions. it must be a wide-ranging process of openness, involving higher education and research and development, regulated professions, government institutions and so on. the democratization of the economy goes hand in hand with a genuine open society: open both internally and externally, that is to say, open to the outside world and open to itself.in little more than one year from now we will be closing our adjustment program with the eu and the imf. in the former half of our adjustment program we had to attend some very concrete, clear and present dangers. we had before us the urgent task of financially stabilizing our economy. we had to focus on the correction our very large financial imbalances by cutting public spending, reforming state owned enterprises, and meeting our national budget targets. i will not bother you with everything we did because our record speaks for itself. i will tell you, though, that we made great progress on that front. just to give you a very important example: we brought our primary structural balance from a 6 per cent deficit in 2010 to a surplus of 0.2 per cent in 2012. that means that two thirds of our structural budgetary adjustment is already accomplished.now, preparing our post-troika future is one of our biggest challenges yet. our strategy of gradually resuming market access has been put in place right from the beginning. and just last week we made a 10-year bond emission which was very well received by investors from all around the world and of all kinds of institutional profiles. the success of this strategy is extremely important. not only because after june 2014 we will no longer have access to official funding from our european partners. but also because the private sector has faced in these last two years a very severe credit scarcity as a result of our sovereign debt crisis. to resume normal conditions of financial flows is a necessary condition for economic growth.the fragmentation of the european financial markets has hit peripheral countries very hard and it is jeopardizing the whole point of the single market. portuguese, irish, greek, spanish or italian businesses are now competing with everyone else under adverse conditions regardless of their individual merits, regardless of their business plans, their ideas, their ability to innovate or their quality of customer service. this is not what the single market is about. the single market is based on the idea of free competition and free trade without geographical discrimination. that is why we strongly supported from day one the project of a banking union and a true financial union. the road to a true financial union, with a common supervision mechanism, a common resolution system and a common deposit insurance scheme, is a necessary one. and we should walk it sooner rather than later.but we have to go beyond financial matters while preparing our future. after a first phase of structural reform we are now entering a second phase of reform for growth and jobs. last month the portuguese government announced its short and medium term strategy for growth based on the industrial renewal of our economy. soon we will announce our strategy for other sectors such as mineral resources and services.- a gradual lowering of business taxes and making the tax system more favorable to investment;- going an extra step in simplifying requirements and reducing the administrative burden borne by business activity with an ex-post approach for licensing to create a more business-friendly and a more job-friendly environment;- accelerating the formation of a true apprenticeship and occupational training system in our public education;- and the creation of a financial institution focused on lending to small and medium enterprises.these are among the main pillars of our growth strategy.we want to increase the share of exports in our economy and give a new and sustainable impetus to our tradable sector. we are diversifying the range of exportable goods and services and we are diversifying our destination markets. and we have concrete results to show. in 2013 our exports will reach 40 per cent of gop, from a low point of just 28 per cent in 2009. moreover, in 2012 machinery goods accounted for almost a quarter of our export growth, and exports for non-european countries grew by 20 per cent. but we want more because we believe we can compete in the global economy. i reject the view that portugal, or the remaining southern european countries for that matter, will not be able to enjoy the benefits that the global economy has brought to many regions in the world. as long as we are properly prepared, portuguese businesses and portuguese citizens will successfully bring their creativity and the fruits of their labour to the world and participate more actively in the global economy. that will be the basis of our future prosperity.as you know, we are also about to enter a second phase of structural reform of the state. and, as i said at the beginning, the report published today will give a very positive contribution while we ponder our options and estimate their impact. many of the choices before us are not easy and we want to make the more reasonable and careful choices. they will all have to be guided by three general principles.first, equality between the public and private sectors. it is a matter of justice that working conditions and retirement requirements should not be different for a private sector worker and a public employee.second, intergenerational equity. it is a question of fairness that future generations be able to enjoy proper protection in old-age and health care like their parents and grandparents did before them. and it is also a question of fairness that young people be spared the oppressive fiscal burden that would be on their shoulders if structural reform never reached the light of day.third, sustainability. we have to strengthen the financial structure of all those services and protection devices that our societies have built. lt is the backbone of our welfare state but it has been weakened by unrealistic promises, institutional failures, and - let us not forget- demographic factors. ignoring financial sustainability now would be an irresponsible and foolish course to take. we have to act now for the sake of the preservation and improvement of our social protection programs and institutions.today we face the most terrible cost of crisis which is unemployment. the personal and social pain caused by unemployment should be an alarm bell for all political and civic agents in portugal and in europe. the current level of unemployment is obviously unacceptable and we are driving all our efforts to fight it and bring it down as fast as we can.in portugal everyone is working very hard so that, some years from now, our children and our grandchildren will be able to see far beyond our present difficulties. so that they can look back and see that this was our turning-point, that a new basis for true, long-lasting prosperity was built during these difficult times.a lot is depending on our progress in portugal. we know that we have the eyes of europe set upon us. our success will be europe's success as well. we count on the support of our european partners. we can count on them because we have given europe good and solid reasons for their continued trust in us. unity and responsibility are the bonds that will make europe stronger and i think that portugal is increasingly seen by everyone as a country which stands for these values and for putting them into practice in real decisions.moreover, divisions among european countries have come to the surface in these last 3 years. an invisible divide has grown between north and south. this is a very serious threat to the european project. to underestimate it would be extremely short-sighted. now is the time to reject those divisions and bring north and south closer together. i believe that portugal can play a leading role in bridging those differences. we are ready to take that leading role. with our historical experience in bringing peoples and civilizations together, with our accumulated credibility as demonstrated in portugal's commitment to europe, we can help restore the unity that the financial crisis has put into question. we can only put the current crisis behind us, both in the south as well as in the north, if we work together. i believe we can do it and portugal will be there to bring a renewed spirit of compromise, unity and responsibility to the european project.thank you very much."
905@Italy: Stay on Course and Focus on the Future@http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/italystayoncourseandfocusonthefuture.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the launch of the oecd economic survey of italy 2013rome, 2 may 2013(as prepared for delivery)thank you for inviting me back to italy. i was here in rome last september with president monti to present a report on “italy: reviving growth and productivity”. at that time, i praised the courageous but essential decisions your country took to engage in ambitious reforms to address the crisis and create the necessary conditions to ensure economic recovery.i am here today to say: stay on course and focus on the future (mantenere la barra diritta e puntare sul futuro!). sure, the situation in italy remains fragile: gdp is likely to fall 1.5 % this year – and we do not expect a rapid recovery – while unemployment is heading to over 12%.but you are making visible progress, which is no small achievement: downside risks have been reduced, confidence is gradually improving, and the economy is projected to exit the recession next year. we believe that the plans outlined in the stability programme should allow the debt/gdp ratio to peak at around 134% of gdp, in 2014 or 2015, from 127% at the end of 2012, and then begin to decline.that’s why, more than ever, it is crucial to maintain the reform momentum. reforms are needed to deal with the legacies of the past, to put them behind us and to pave the way for a brighter future. first and foremost, italy has a long standing issue of poor competitiveness which predates the crisis and needs to be addressed. over the past 20 years, italy’s real gdp growth per capita has been the weakest of all oecd countries. this reflects very low underlying productivity growth, which has added to fiscal difficulties and has resulted in stagnant (and recently declining) real income levels. this must change!stay the course: a three-pronged approach to reform.the oecd economic survey of italy 2013 that i am here to present and that will be the basis of the discussions during the seminar highlights three main recommendations:let me elaborate on the three key recommendations from the survey.italy has already achieved sizeable fiscal consolidation since the crisis of autumn 2011. the current levels of interest rates on italian public debt suggest that financial markets recognise this progress. their relatively calm reaction to political uncertainty this year indicates a degree of confidence as well.but we should be careful not to read too much into the numbers! support from the european central bank, which is sometimes active and sometimes implicit, underpins part of this improvement, and confidence can evaporate without much warning. the remaining spread between italian and german interest rates – which cannot really be justified purely by the difference in your levels of debt -- says something about perceptions of risk in investing in italy.the oecd supports the targets outlined in the recent stability programme and the measures needed to reach the objectives for this year and for 2014. they should lead to a long-term decline in italy’s high level of public debt. but we must remember that, even so, the debt level will remain high for some time. that’s why it is so important to continue to pursue consolidation on a structural basis, even if takes longer to reach the headline target if the economy weakens. but let’s not forget that composition of consolidation must be improved to become more pro-growth and equity-friendly. cutting taxes on labour is the thing to do if you really care about growth and jobs. other tax cuts can wait. in all cases, tax cuts require spending cuts to be sustainable.italy’s fiscal policy strategy needs to be complemented with pro-growth reforms. as we have said to many countries, the potential payoffs of “going structural” are substantial. our analysis suggests that the structural reforms adopted since late 2011 could raise italy’s potential gdp by about 5½ % over the next 10 years. this means improved competitiveness and economic efficiency. but it also means better prospects for employment.for instance, an important reform is the extended powers given to the antitrust authority to monitor the behaviour of public administrations at the national, regional and local levels who violate the principles of competition. other achievements are the labour market and social protection reforms, which introduced more flexibility where needed, e.g. in dismissal proceedings and first-time contracts, and measures to reduce over-reliance on atypical contracts. it is important to complement this effort with training and job-search support aligned with the social safety net. achieving this coordination will be one of the most difficult tasks of the next few years.while some reforms don’t put a burden on the budget, such as those related to regulation, for example, others draw more heavily on budgetary resources, such as widening the social safety net, maintaining the health system, reducing the tax burden on labour.how can we finance reforms in these areas? as mentioned italy must stay the course in fiscal consolidation. taxes should be reduced where they can most help growth and jobs. the reviews of policy and spending can point to areas where savings can be made and resources can be allocated to other ends. in the short term, you can reduce many of the specific subsidies or tax allowances that go to firms, redirecting that revenue to prioritised expenditure. over time, it will be possible to gradually reduce the overall level of taxation.just as for fiscal consolidation, structural reforms also require effective implementation and a commitment to give them time to work. this means avoiding backsliding under pressure from interest groups and avoiding piecemeal changes. policy implementation leads me into the third point i wanted to touch on.the economic survey devotes a chapter to the various dimensions of policy implementation: the design and adoption of legislation, and the role of governmental bodies in endorsing policy and in making it effective, transparent and accountable. transparency and accountability are also essential for promoting efficiency and god governance, helping to fight corruption and minimising vulnerability to organised crime.the oecd strongly supports the wider use of consip, the public procurement body, to reduce costs and reduce corruption. and we believe that improving the efficiency of civil justice, like the streamlining process currently under way in your country, and through attention to sometimes perverse incentives, will both save resources and support a more efficient business sector.focus on the future, but be sensitive to the present!ladies and gentlemen: focus on the future but be sensitive to the present! good adjustment programmes are the ones that can be adjusted! as i said before, and i will say it again, italy needs to simultaneously pursue fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to free it from the vicious cycle of low growth, high unemployment, high debt, and distrust in government and institutions. but we cannot forget that reforms are about improving welfare and the well-being of people.the recession has impacted all of us, but in particular, the most vulnerable and our future – our youth. as in many other oecd countries, inequality is high in italy and has been exacerbated by the tough jobs climate since the downturn. the unemployment rate in italy has reached almost 12% – a hard number to cope with in and of itself – but youth unemployment is three times as high. in fact, it has already reached almost 38%.italy’s tomorrow depends on the actions it takes today. therefore, it is imperative to institute policies to protect those who cannot protect themselves and ensure intergenerational prosperity.first, the burden of the adjustment should be shared equitably. it means favouring measures that are the least harmful to growth and social cohesion, and pursuing policy actions with least short-term and social costs. for instance, in the short term, it might be wise under certain conditions to delay the implementation of such labour market provisions as those on temporary contracts until economic conditions improve.equitable also means paying your fair share of taxes. this requires continued action to improve tax compliance by all taxpayers, whether it is by large businesses artificially shifting taxable profits to low-tax jurisdictions or by rich individuals under declaring their income.measures, like redditometro (“income meter”), which helps to pin down individual income by tracking the purchase of consumer goods and comparing the total to declared income render the administrative costs associated with tax evasion high and put an unfair burden on legitimate – meaning honest and tax paying – individuals and businesses. when tax evasion is widespread, the trade-off between softening anti-evasion measures (which would lower the administrative costs) and high administrative costs is merited.so, what are the next steps? there is more than one way forward and choices can be made on the exact design of future policies. unfortunately, there are no easy answers. the burden lies heavily on policy makers -- responsible policy makers – to convince the public of the need for action and to bring about consensus on what is needed. restoring trust is part of the story. the oecd stands ready to support this process.
906@Italy: New government must build on recent reforms@http://www.oecd.org/economy/italy-new-government-must-build-on-recent-reforms.htm@02/05/2013 - italy has made considerable progress in strengthening its public finances and adopting wide-ranging reforms to boost economic growth. the new government must build on past achievements and ensure that they are sustained and reinforced, says a new oecd report.the latest economic survey of italy says implementation of the key 2012 reforms aimed at improving the dynamism of labour and product markets must be implemented effectively. this will improve italy’s persistently weak productivity and boost the country’s international competitiveness, the report says.poor competitiveness, a drop in bank lending and the immediate impact of public spending cuts and tax rises on households and businesses continue to undermine growth in the short term. the report forecasts gdp to fall by 1.5% this year before inching up by 0.5% in 2014. presenting the report in rome, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “amid recession and rising unemployment it is sometimes difficult to see light at the end of the tunnel. but i am convinced that a commitment to the current reform strategy will result in better living standards and a stronger, more dynamic italian economy. ” (read the full speech)the report says maintaining fiscal consolidation is key to putting italy’s debt-to-gdp ratio on a downward path over the medium term. budgetary measures should concentrate on permanent spending cuts to avoid already high levels of taxation. restructuring the tax system is necessary to reduce inefficient expenditure and to make compliance simpler and cheaper. taxes on low-paid workers are higher than in most other oecd countries, the report says. lowering tax rates of second earners in families would help tackle the low participation rate of women in the italian labour market.the immediate task of the new government should be to implement fully recent reforms, monitor their impact and make improvements where needed. high on the list is ensuring the planned transport regulator is established rapidly and that the competition authority makes effective use of its new powers.the oecd recommends a number of ways in which the reforms can be broadened. they include:• removing remaining regulatory restrictions that undermine competition in retail and professional services;• making the labour market more dynamic by providing more support for job-seeking and training and providing a broader social safety net;• aligning wages more closely to productivity, through negotiations with social partners.the report also recommends ways of tackling potential obstacles to effective implementation of laws and regulation. the report calls for greater simplification and transparency, increased use of performance-orientated management and a streamlining of court processes.further information on the economic survey of italy is available at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/italy-2013.htm. you are invited to include this link in coverage.to obtain a copy of the survey, or for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 9700).
907@Homo Economicus: an uncertain guide@http://www.oecd.org/economy/homo-economicus-an-uncertain-guide.htm@as humans, we face a constant internal conflict between immediate ‌gratification and more prudent living. this conflict is also apparent in society. how can we ensure that the homo economicus within us takes the decisions that best affect our lives, and economies? ‌epicurus, who has many disciples among those aspiring to happiness, concurs with the idea which jeremy bentham in particular was to expound in the 18th century: one should seek pleasure and avoid pain. and yet epicurus is at pains to distinguish between “moving” pleasures, relating to the satisfaction of a need and therefore intermixed with pain, and “static”, pure pleasures predicated on satisfied desires. plato, in the gorgias, is more radical. in his eyes, the search for happiness suffers from the fundamental contradiction that happiness needs desire, whereas desire excludes happiness. for plato, happiness, if that is what we want to call it, is the reward for a “good life”, not its goal. a good life, or eudaimonia, consists in finding one’s place in the world of humans, like one star orbiting harmoniously around another. aristotle wisely concluded that because reason and virtue were the distinctive characteristics of man, “the lovers of what is noble find pleasant the things that are by nature pleasant. and virtuous actions are thus pleasant for such people and inherent in their own nature. their life, therefore, has no further need for pleasure as a sort of adventitious charm, but has its pleasure in itself.” economists have long challenged the distinction drawn between vulgar pleasures and those which elevate the soul. admittedly, those who understand the beauty of a work of art are happier than those who don’t. the effort that needs to be expended to understand the artistic power of an opera is repaid by a more intense happiness, as with an investment. but this does not create a qualitative difference between opera and television, simply a difference in degree. variables such as one’s purpose in life or positive relations both with others and with oneself, count for much in the happiness of individuals. but why should these be opposed to the search for other, more trivial satisfactions such as a nice car or an attractive apartment? it’s all a matter of proportion. like a king who has all the levers of power, homo economicus would be able to choose freely, according to this model, between good and evil, between spending time at work and having a lie-in. can you believe that? far from marshalling his concerns like a lawyer, every man is a composite of diverse personalities cohabiting more or less harmoniously. you can have an appointment that is vital for your career and still dive into a river to save a passer-by from drowning. there is no premeditation at work here. in response to an emotion, you switch from one state of mind to another. in his book is capitalism moral?, andré comte-sponville proposed a very useful classification inspired by pascal’s three powers. while the latter distinguished between flesh, reason and the heart (which “has its reasons which reason does not know”), comte-sponville proposed four categories: the economy, politics, morality and love. each has its own logic. a mother who looks after her children out of duty would be a bad mother. a male or female politician who relied upon morality to guide his or her actions would doubtless make a pitiful manager. likewise, the economy has its own rules, those of calculation and a quest for profit, which are distinct from those of morality or politics. ‌even within choices held to be economic and rational, conflicting beings still live inside us, real dr jekylls and mr hydes, the inseparable twins who hate each other. i may wish to save for my retirement, or for the future of my children, and yet can’t seem to do so as, “in spite of myself”, i spend the household savings. the desire to live in accordance with an idea conflicts with the desire for immediate gratification which moves in the opposite direction. how can they be taught to live together?‌  the famous example of ulysses and the sirens illustrates some possible methods. jon elster, who famously commented on this passage from odyssey felt that ulysses must “rationally manage his irrationality”. i know what my temptations are, namely to succumb to the song of the sirens, i manage them by chaining the person i don’t want to become to the mast. if i go on a diet to lose weight, i will avoid walking in front of a cake shop. if i need to save for my old age, i will make a non-liquid investment to avoid spending it. i fight against the person i might turn into. the homo economicus living inside me is having a hard time, he maximises a utility but doesn’t know whose utility it is. the conflict between the search for immediate gratification and concern to provide for the long term bears witness to the difficulty of being “reasonable”. for many years economists thought that the problem was simply a trade-off between a reward today and one tomorrow. if you were to ask me whether i would like to have €100 tomorrow or €200 in a year and a day, i would say €200 in a year and a day. the return is good, so i’m quite happy to wait for my reward. but if you offered me a choice between €100 right this minute and €200 in a year’s time, i would say €100 now, even though the interval in time between the two options remains the same (a year in both cases). this is because the present moment wakens a different individual to the one i wanted to be yesterday–somebody who wants everything “immediately”! if i understand my own temptations i will arrange things “in advance” to make sure that i don’t have a choice, that way i will be obliged to accept €200 in a year’s time without having the €100 option. like ulysses, i shall try to tie myself to a mast in order to rise above my status of alcoholic, pervert, glutton, etc. fortunately i’m not alone. society helps me manage the most weighty decisions. old age or sickness insurance is compulsory, as is education for children. the us, which allows greater personal choice in this area than europe, is also the country where we can see the direst forms of poverty, and for this very same reason. the great us bankruptcy of 2008 is largely a result of the absurd way in which the most vulnerable members of the population were driven into over-indebtedness. financial deregulation in the us did everything it could to push households into using their credit cards or taking out mortgages they couldn’t afford. it untied ulysses, and america drowned. subscribe to the oecd observer including the oecd yearbookby daniel cohen, professor of economics at the école normale supérieure and vice president and founding member of the paris school of economics.
908@Return from the dead?@http://www.oecd.org/economy/return-from-the-dead.htm@old ways of thinking won’t bring developed countries back to economic life. weighed down by the legacy of the crisis, they also face deep challenges like a faltering labour supply and slowing innovation. and growth itself won’t be enough–it must also be stable, inclusive and green. the need for structural reforms has never been greater, but they will require difficult trade-offs. in short, policymakers in the oecd area, and the oecd itself, face daunting challenges. parents in oecd countries have long had confidence that their children will enjoy a higher standard of material wellbeing than they did. sadly, that confidence is no longer there. why? clearly, our starting point is not a good one. oecd estimates indicate that the average member country has seen its level of potential output drop by three percentage points since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis in 2007. moreover, the recovery to date has been slow and halting under the influence of a debt overhang that has severely affected both borrowers and the banks that lent to them. the traditional quick fix of macroeconomic stimulus also seems to be both increasingly ineffective and encumbered by dangerous side effects. studies of previous credit-driven “boom-bust” cycles indicate that what we are witnessing now is typical. the sluggishness and associated ennui could well continue for an uncomfortably long time. there are deeper issues, too. robert gordon, one of the world’s best-known academic authorities on growth issues, suggests that future growth in us consumption per capita (for all but the top 1%) could fall “below 0.5% per year for an extended period of decades”. this conclusion should raise serious concerns for oecd countries, many of which face common challenges. another problem is the faltering supply of labour. this reflects not just slower population growth in most oecd countries, but also slower rates of increase in labour force participation and, often, a growing antipathy to immigration. moreover, under the influence of technological change and globalisation, employers in oecd countries need workers with both highly specialised production skills and generalised problem-solving capacities. many workers, including high school and even university graduates, don’t have those skills and are therefore being left behind. this hurts both growth and inclusiveness. we are also likely to see low rates of saving and, thus, a slow rate of growth of the capital stock. the ratio of private investment to gdp has been trending down for decades, and there is no obvious reason to expect a reversal. indeed, a recent report from the group of thirty, a nonprofit grouping of senior figures from the public and private sectors and academia, suggests particular concern for the future availability of finance for longer-term investments. as for public sector investment, it seems increasingly likely that it will suffer given the broad trend towards reining in sovereign debt levels and the need for deficit reduction. longer-term issues also need to be confronted. one of these has to do with the environment. even though commodity prices are declining, doubts about the sustainability of today’s economic model are increasing. is the recent, much accelerated, pace of depletion of natural resources sustainable? what might be the implications for future living standards, particularly for the poor, of rising prices for food and energy? in addition, current production processes have massive externalities that threaten the environment and well-being in other ways, not least via climate change. is this sustainable for much longer? the apparent slowing pace of innovation is also a concern. most studies of the determinants of growth give pride of place to increases in “total factor productivity”, which is ultimately driven by innovation. can we count on more innovation to power future growth in living standards? rising to these formidable new challenges will not be easy, but it can be done. in particular, we must resist the temptation to retreat into old belief systems. first, we must face up more courageously to the immediate problems confronting us. overindebtedness implies the need for explicit debt reduction and plans to recapitalise or wind down imprudent lenders–the nordic model rather than the japanese model. we must also resist the belief that demand stimulus alone can restore “strong, sustainable and balanced growth”. clearly, demand stimulus has its place during the recovery from the global economic and financial crisis. but sustained growth will depend not on demand stimulus, but instead on structural reforms. second, relying on increasingly impotent macroeconomic policies, and refusing to consider policies that might work, is surely not the way forward. if there is still much to learn about making structural reforms effective, particularly given multiple objectives, some points would seem pretty obvious. smarter regulation of product markets and increased competition would increase efficiency and lower living costs, and could have significant effects on international imbalances. in many cases, it would seem that such reforms can have quite rapid payoffs. making labour markets less rigid, particularly with respect to employment protection, would encourage more hiring and probably more training. raising the participation rate of women in the workforce, notably through the provision of better education and care in early childhood, but also other measures, would provide multiple benefits. so too would raising the effective retirement age. an education system better tuned to future employment opportunities, and with resources more focused on the disadvantaged, would provide more and better workers, aid inclusiveness, and encourage innovation. public sector investment, if carefully evaluated and undertaken, can provide higheryielding state assets to service higher liabilities. many more recommendations of a similar nature are routinely made by the economic development and review committee in its economic surveys and going for growth project, drawing on the vast base of knowledge developed over the years by the oecd. none of this is to deny that reforms can have downsides. for example, lowering employment protection in downturns might lead initially to more job losses than gains, and more and better education raises the issue of financing. these downsides must also be recognised and addressed. nor is it possible to state that we know everything we need to know to pursue good public policies. indeed, it was the recognition of our analytical shortcomings that recently led the council of the oecd to initiate the new approaches to economic challenges (naec) project. evidently, throwing off old belief systems requires creating new ones, and new beliefs must be based as much as possible on both sound theory and factual evidence about what actually works. in many ways, we are just beginning the task of laying the analytical groundwork for such new approaches. of course, knowing what to do or to recommend is only one part of public policy. actually implementing what needs to be done to provide “strong, sustainable and balanced growth” will be still more difficult. in the globalised world in which we live, many desirable initiatives will require a degree of international co-operation, in effect ceding some sovereignty, that might prove hard to achieve. at the domestic level, those profiting from current practices will resist change fiercely. moreover, structural change is, by definition, destabilising and could have unforeseen social and political ramifications. yet without change in our public policies, the objectives we seek will not be met. and if we fail, we risk being left with a bleak economic future that would surely be even more prone to turmoil. john kenneth galbraith summed it up well when he wrote: “politics is not the art of the possible. it consists in choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous.” we must now get on with the more appetising of these unappetising options. recommended links subscribe to the oecd observer including the oecd yearbook
909@A recipe for trust@http://www.oecd.org/economy/recipe-for-trust.htm@have the policy errors that contributed to the global economic crisis been rectified? sharan burrow shares her vision for building trust and restoring confidence in the countries still suffering from the crisis. the global economy has been on life support since 2008. many countries are in recession, others see growth slowing, unemployment is set to rise again from already high levels, and a generation of young people is being scarred by joblessness. the robustness of democratic systems and multilateralism cannot be taken for granted–they are under pressure. these realities are not conducive to building citizen trust in the economy. the oecd’s latest response to the crisis, the creation of a new initiative called “new approaches to economic challenges”, is a welcome move. the stakes could not be higher, not just for the organisation itself but for oecd countries, and indeed the global economy. the oecd’s origins lay in the reconstruction of europe in the wake of the great depression and the second world war. policy failures in the 1920s and 1930s resulted in the depression that ultimately led to a global war. in the current crisis, there is no room for complacency. there is a breakdown of trust among citizens, government and business. the social contract is broken, the anger is mounting. the political response could again result in extremism and xenophobia. before the crisis, there were several alternative forms of market economy, with different policy frameworks, strengths and weaknesses. the trade union report exiting from the crisis: towards a model of more equitable and sustainable growth, published by the trade union advisory committee to the oecd, the international trade union confederation and the european trade union institute in 2011, was anchored in this “models of capitalism debate”. some countries have weathered the storm better than others. some countries and policies were more responsible for creating the storm. some policies, long advocated by financial markets and international financial institutions, contributed to the rapid spread of the crisis around the world. the systemic operation of global markets prior to 2008 revealed a series of imbalances in the global economy between the growth of financial markets and of the real economy, between countries with an external deficit and a surplus, between profit and capital shares in the distribution of national income, between the very top incomes and the other “99%”, and between the economic and the environmental pillars of sustainable development. environmental damage and scarcity of resources must be factored into production systems, so that the economy can move to zero emissions, zero waste and zero exposure to hazardous substances. new economic thinking should also help us understand how to reach full employment and decent working conditions in a resource-constrained world. the global financial and economic crisis has invalidated the belief that indiscriminate labour market deregulation and weak labour market institutions are necessary ingredients of economic and employment success. rather, it has proved a recipe for growing income inequality and, in some countries, the rise of precarious work. it now has a serious economic, as well as social and political, cost.  ‌those countries that had achieved high employment and a more equitable distribution of incomes focused attention on the broad sweep of labour market policy, including skills formation systems before labour market entry that give workers a sense of occupational identity and selfconfidence; an emphasis on lifelong learning as a route to employability; a focus on the balance of power between capital and labour–including the strength of the trade unions and the extent of collective bargaining coverage; the pursuit of policies to narrow unjustifiable differences in treatment between groups of workers; a combination of high unemployment benefits; and job search obligations with high levels of investment in active labour market programmes to get the unemployed back to work. tax systems have done a weaker and weaker job of collecting necessary revenues to fund a modern state (via base erosion and profit shifting) and reducing inequality (through excessive concessions at the high end). we must examine how taxation policies can be ameliorated to improve both growth and equality. this must include a reassessment of the shift of the tax share to consumption and achieve broader taxation on property and wealth. beyond the role of public policy to reduce income inequality, the lessons of the crisis should call into question “light regulation” and the tolerance of imbalances that contributed to the crisis. reducing the complexity, the lack of transparency and, in many cases, the size of the financial sector in the oecd area as a whole is necessary, through regulation, financial taxation and structural reforms. the priority is to make the financial sector serve the needs of the real economy and prevent financial speculation from damaging sustainable growth prospects. at national level, policymakers should devote more attention to the question of innovative institutions and to the role of government through active industrial policies as sources of growth and demand generation. in a context of global value chains and production networks increasingly influencing the location of production and employment, it is also essential that oecd countries and companies achieve competitiveness on the basis of a “high road” strategy that includes respecting labour standards, raising skill levels and motivating employees. finally, economic performance has to be judged by wider criteria than gdp per capita, which by itself tells us little about the quality of life enjoyed by citizens. it tells us nothing about the distribution of incomes, nothing about differences between rich and poor in terms of health and life expectancy, nothing about social mobility, nothing about environmental sustainability and other issues that are crucial for the quality of life. most importantly, it tells us nothing at all about whether most citizens have the capabilities they need to choose lives that they have reason to value. the full burden of the economic crisis has fallen on working people. the oecd has a crucial role to play in redressing this injustice. subscribe to the oecd observer and oecd yearbook
910@Asia’s Challenges@http://www.oecd.org/economy/asia-challenges.htm@the forces driving asia’s rapid growth–new technology, globalisation, and market-oriented reform–are also fuelling rising inequality. some income divergence is inevitable in times of fast economic development, but that shouldn’t make for complacency, especially in the face of rising inequality in people’s opportunities to develop their human capital and income-earning capacity. against the backdrop of an elusive global recovery, asia continues to lead global growth. but even asia’s performance is down on where it was before the crisis, and governments must remain vigilant to the risk of further global shocks in the near term. they face other challenges, too–important long-term problems that must be addressed now if asia is to build on what has already been achieved. asia’s rapid growth in recent decades has lifted hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty, but the region remains home to two-thirds of the world’s poor, with more than 800 million asians still living on less than $1.25 a day and 1.7 billion surviving on less than $2 a day. poverty reduction remains a daunting task. one of the most visible side-effects of asia’s rapid growth has been environmental damage. the reliance on fossil fuels has degraded air quality and eco-systems, reduced the supply of clean water, and created significant health hazards. asia has become the world’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, which are linked to global warming and climate change. its cities are amongst the most polluted and the most vulnerable to extreme weather events. recent climate-related disasters in china, the philippines and thailand are a reminder that asian policymakers must act now to protect their citizens and mitigate and reverse the signs of climate change to secure sustainable growth for the future. a new, perhaps more complex, challenge for developing asia is how to confront rapidly rising inequality. the gap between asia’s rich and poor has widened alarmingly in the past two decades. in many countries, the richest 1% of households account for close to 10% of total consumption, and the top 5% account for more than 20%. the gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has increased in much of the region: taking developing asia as a single unit, the gini coefficient has increased from 39 to 46. and the gap is not only in income. inequality of opportunity is prevalent and is a crucial factor in widening income inequality. for example, school-age children from households in the poorest income quintile are up to five times more likely to be out of primary and secondary school than their peers in the richest quintile; infant mortality rates among the poorest households were 10 times higher than those among the affluent households; in south asia, women’s labour force participation is only 40% that of men’s; and in central and west asia, girls’ primary and secondary school enrolment levels are 20% lower than those of boys. for developing asia as a whole, 1.7 billion people (45% of the population) lack access to sanitation and 680 million are without access to electricity. a recent asian development bank (adb) study cites three forces behind this rising inequality: new technology, globalisation, and market-oriented reform–ironically, they are also the primary drivers of asia’s rapid growth. these forces have created enormous economic opportunities, but the opportunities have not been equally shared by all. three groups, in particular, have benefited most. the first are the owners of capital, who, as a result of the bias of technological progress, have seen their share of national income rise while that of labour has fallen. asia’s large pool of available labour has also depressed wage rates relative to returns on capital. the second group is made up of those living in cities and near coasts and who have gained greatly from better infrastructure and market access. for example, rural-urban and inter-provincial gaps combined account for 54% of total income inequality in china and about 32% in india. and finally, better educated graduates make up a third group which has managed to increase its income, thereby widening the gap relative to those with just a basic education. moreover, the impact of these forces has been compounded by various forms of unequal access to opportunity–to earn income from labour and to build human capital–caused by institutional weaknesses, market distortions, and social exclusion. rising inequality can dampen the poverty-reduction impact of economic growth, and weaken the basis of growth. had inequality remained stable in asian economies, instead of increasing, growth would have lifted another 240 million people out of poverty between 1990 and 2010. this is equivalent to 6.5% of developing asia’s population in 2010. high and rising inequality can undermine long-term growth by wasting human capital, increasing social tension, weakening governance and increasing pressure for inefficient populist policies. fortunately, asia’s policymakers are responding to rising inequality. more and more countries are placing inclusive growth–growth based on equality of opportunity–at the heart of their development policy. in an informal survey of asian policymakers carried out by the adb, more than 65% of respondents agreed that income inequality in their country was high or very high. almost all reported that incomes in their respective countries were becoming more unequal. a majority felt that success in reducing poverty was not enough to justify widening inequality. because the forces behind rising inequality are also the engines of productivity and income growth, policy options to reverse these trends become more complex. a distinction needs to be made between the income differences that arise as economies and individuals take advantage of opportunities created by new technology, trade, and efficiency-enhancing reforms, versus those that are generated by unequal access to market opportunities and public services. the latter require a rigorous policy response, especially since they are magnified by the driving forces of growth, lead to inefficiency and inequity, and undermine sustainability of growth. reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive in asia, therefore, requires the following mutually-re-enforcing policy actions. first, fiscal policy must play an important role. spending on social sectors–health, education and social protection–should be increased to build human capacities, especially of the disadvantaged, and reduce inequality in human capital. this can be achieved without upsetting fiscal stability if governments raise more revenue by improving tax systems and administration and switching inefficient general subsidies such as those on fuels to more targeted transfers. at the same time, social sector spending should be used more effectively and efficiently, through better allocation and by plugging leakages. second, the gap between rural and urban areas and across provinces must be bridged. regions lagging behind need more and better infrastructure–not just in the form of physical connectivity, but also through policies and institutions that ease the flow of goods and services. growth centres could be developed in lagging regions. regional inequality in china, for example, declined after it introduced its greater western development strategy. barriers to migration from poor and rural to more prosperous and urban areas should also be removed. third, productive and decent jobs are a must for inclusive growth. this requires a business environment conducive to private investment and a well balanced composition of growth between industry, services, and agriculture. also, eliminating distortions that favour capital over labour, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, building labour market institutions, and setting up public employment schemes as a temporary bridge to address pockets of unemployment and underemployment can help raise labour incomes. finally, measures designed to create more opportunities and equalise access to them must be supported by good governance in the form of promoting wider participation, strengthening rule of law, reducing corruption, and eliminating social exclusion. asia has enjoyed a remarkable period of growth and poverty reduction, but the new realities of technological progress, more globally integrated markets, and greater market orientation are magnifying inequalities in physical and human capital. asian policymakers must redouble their efforts to bring opportunities in employment, education, health and other key social services to all–thereby making growth more inclusive.
911@Reforms for a cleaner, healthier environment in China@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k480c2dh6kf-en@china’s exceptional economic expansion has led to rising energy demand and pollution as well as other environmental pressures. strong efforts by the government have moderated emissions of some types of air and water pollution from high levels but others, including greenhouse gas emissions, continue to rise. poor air and water quality threaten human health, create other costs and reduce well-being. the 12th five year plan aims at further reducing pollution and at other environmental improvements. to achieve these goals in a cost-effective manner wide-ranging reforms are needed. reliance on command-and-control measures ought to make way gradually for well-implemented market-based approaches. energy and water pricing need to be reformed to provide stronger incentives for end-users. so does pollution pricing. a carbon tax should be given serious consideration, especially if pilot carbon emissions trading schemes turn out to be difficult to implement. as well, stronger standards are needed, including for motor vehicles and fuels. efforts to enhance environmental enforcement, particularly at the local level, will also be key to further progress. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of china (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/china).
912@How to get it right: government balances, growth and income inequality@http://www.oecd.org/economy/government-balances-growth-and-income-inequality.htm@"austerity programmes to restore order to public finances can add to the woes of already struggling economies, leading to more job losses and social hardship. but there are ways for governments to put their fiscal houses in order, while supporting growth and reducing income inequality at the same time.the crisis affecting oecd economies is now in its sixth year, yet sizeable efforts are still needed to put government finances back on a sustainable base, while underpinning growth. at the same time, pressure is mounting to tackle the deepening social problems with policies to reduce exclusion and inequality. it is a difficult balancing act, which few countries can ignore. indeed, the two largest oecd economies, the us and japan, are among those countries requiring the most fiscal consolidation of all, to the order of 10% of gdp. consolidation requirements are also large in troubled countries of the euro area and the uk. what impact will such prolonged and significant policy efforts have? fiscal consolidation strategies, however important, have been questioned for adding to the woes of already struggling economies, and leading to even higher unemployment and more social hardship. we can gauge this by looking at the so-called fiscal multipliers–the decline in economic growth for every 1 percentage-point reduction in the government’s fiscal deficit. though there is some debate about the size of these multipliers, which vary widely across countries and at different times, it is clear that their size was underestimated. they are higher than usual, largely because low or zero interest rates are making it harder for monetary policy to offset the adverse impact of austere fiscal policies. moreover, when many countries that interact together tighten policy at the same time, the negative impact is exacerbated as the chill wind of austerity in one country is felt among trading partners. yet governments have little choice but to forge on with consolidation, given very high levels of public debt and the need to restore financial market confidence. indeed, high and growing debt ultimately depresses growth and increases fragility. a major policy concern is how this austerity will affect income inequality. a trend increase in income disparities was already a concern in many oecd countries prior to the financial crisis, but inequality has likely widened since. the gini coefficient for disposable income, which measures income distribution whereby a value 0 means all households receive the same income, and 1 means just one household receives all income, has risen from an average of around 0.25 in the mid-1980s to around 0.3. moreover, the financial crisis has drawn attention to excessive and distorting incentive pay in the financial sector, which many people believe to be a key culprit in the crisis. there is real risk that fiscal consolidation will worsen this inequality, sparking more social anger that can threaten even the most carefully designed and legitimate consolidation programmes, or even destabilise public institutions, including the eu. there is also some discussion as to whether widening inequality can in turn undermine growth. for instance, the concentration of income and wealth among the few can spur reckless financial decision-making to the detriment of growth. also, there is a danger that declining incomes or a rise in poverty will affect productivity.the situation is grave. according to current consolidation plans, most governments aim to improve the budget primarily via restraining spending. social security transfers are planned to decline in cyclically adjusted terms in about half of all oecd countries, while adjusted household income taxes will increase in most of these countries. the net redistributive effect of all measures combined is likely to be negative. this has to be avoided. fortunately, despite all the tightening to date, there is still scope for countries to adjust their fiscal consolidation efforts and redesign them in such a way so as to achieve more fiscal sustainability, more growth and more equity. to do this, governments must act on both sides of the fiscal equation, while also introducing structural reforms. on the expenditure side, cutting benefits and other cash transfers often significantly increases inequality. however, cuts can be designed to have less impact on lower earners, and be supplemented by structural measures in a way that minimises, or even eliminates, any adverse effects on wealth distribution. for instance, cuts in unemployment-related benefits tend to hit poorer people most, particularly when weak economic activity prevents an offsetting rise in employment. such cuts might not be desirable during deep and protracted downturns such as the present one. moreover, there is still considerable scope among oecd countries to improve benefit-tax systems, including disability benefits, to encourage higher employment and greater equity. such measures should be reinforced by structural reforms, for example, to support unemployment policies that keep the unemployed in touch with the labour market, and by making it easier to set up and run businesses, so generating revenue and creating jobs. raising the effective retirement age would be another good place to take action. many people still retire young, compared with today’s robust life expectancy, and this often means a drop in income. later retirement has the potential to raise earnings and so reduce income inequality, as well as giving economic activity a boost. true, acting on this will not produce immediate budgetary savings, but addressing it should at least reassure financial markets that the long-term fiscal outlook is in safe hands. education and healthcare reforms should also rank highly on the policy agenda, since these areas are both big-ticket spending items and vital for social well-being and progress. most countries have substantial margins to improve the efficiency of health and education provision, allowing for large savings without compromising equity or service quality, and possibly improving both. however, such gains might take several years to fully materialise and could lower employment growth in the near term. the revenue side of fiscal policies merits particular attention, since cutting certain tax expenditures can increase both equity and economic growth. many tax expenditures have been introduced without serious welfare considerations, although there are exceptions like income tax credits and payroll tax rebates for low-wage workers. the value of many other tax reliefs– including tax breaks for health and childcare, education, owner-occupied housing, and various saving schemes–often increases for earners in higher tax brackets. this is costly and hardly helps improve equity, and should be addressed. meanwhile, tax hikes that can bolster equality and have relatively little impact on long-term growth, such as on real estate, should be considered. however, serious consideration must first be given to the state of the housing market, which has been struggling in many countries. moreover, to be effective, additional measures, such as carrying out proper (and possibly costly) valuation of property, might be needed. meanwhile, hikes in capital income taxes would be positive for equity and would not necessarily distort growth, while shifting tax burdens away from labour and towards green consumption taxes, for instance, would also bring benefits. though fiscal consolidation must continue for a while, progress especially in europe has been substantial, as many countries have been taking the right steps. if more similar reforms had been made in the past couple of years, the benefits might already be starting to lift the economy. hopefully, we have seen the bottom of the crisis, but there is still time for policymakers across the oecd area to carry out reforms and give more weight to the tax expenditure side of the fiscal equation, for the sake of both restoring sustainable growth and improving equality. rawdanowicz, l., e. wurzel and a. christensen (2013), ""the equity implications of

913@Japan is poised for expansion but must curb government debt@http://www.oecd.org/economy/japan-is-poised-for-expansion-but-must-curb-government-debt.htm@"23/04/2013 - japan is poised for an economic expansion, but long-term growth prospects remain contingent on additional efforts to revitalise the economy and reduce unsustainable levels of public debt, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of japan.the new survey, presented in tokyo by oecd secretary-general angel gurría, forecasts the japanese economy will grow by about 1.5% annually in 2013 and 2014. the report hails prime minister shinzo abe’s three-pronged strategy -- bold monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy and a growth strategy -- to end 15 years of deflation and relaunch economic growth.the survey points out that japan’s gross public debt reached 220% of gdp in 2012 - the highest level ever recorded in the oecd area – while the budget deficit is hovering around 10% of gdp. with the debt ratio moving further into uncharted territory, the report underlines the urgent need to restore fiscal sustainability. “the sustainability of public finances is a major concern, but i hope that the medium-term fiscal plan that the government has promised to present later this year will help improve the situation,” mr gurría said.the plan should include spending cuts and tax increases large enough to bring the budget back into primary surplus by 2020 and stabilise the public debt ratio. a detailed and credible package is essential to maintain market confidence in japan's fiscal situation, mitigating the risk of a run-up in long-term interest rates, the oecd said.the survey covers a range of other topics, including recommendations to:use regulatory reform to boost growth. this is particularly necessary in the agriculture sector, where high levels of public support and stringent market access restrictions protect a dwindling number of ageing, uncompetitive farmers. the oecd says japan can create a more competitive agriculture sector by promoting consolidation of farmland to boost productivity; phasing out supply control measures; and shifting to less distorting forms of government support. a more market-oriented agricultural sector would promote japan's integration in the world economy, thus boosting japan's growth potential.promote green growth and restructure the energy sector. the fukushima nuclear accident has opened the door to a new energy policy. the reduced role of nuclear power increases the need for other energy sources, including renewables, which currently account for about 11% of electricity generation, or about half the oecd average. increasing the use of renewables will green the economy and help japan reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. japan also has an opportunity to restructure the electricity sector, including the unbundling of generation and transmission and expanding competition in the wholesale and retail markets.increase women’s participation in the labour force. to face the challenges posed by the ageing population, japan needs to make the most of its human resources, particularly women. . this will require, inter alia, reforming the tax and social security system, encouraging better work-life balance, and increasing the availability of affordable childcare.further information on the economic survey of japan is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/japan-2013.htm. you are invited to include this link in coverage.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd’s media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."
914@Written Statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee - April 2013@http://www.oecd.org/economy/written-statement-to-international-monetary-and-financial-committee-april2013.htm@after a marked slowdown in late 2012, the global economy appears now to be picking up. output growth was weak in most advanced countries in the last quarter of 2012 and the increase in global trade volumes came to a virtual halt. growth among emerging economies has remained much faster than that of advanced countries on average, although with significant differences across countries.the outlook in the first half of 2013 is for a return to moderate growth in the united states and an acceleration from low levels in japan, boosted by new policy measures. in europe, a meaningful recovery is likely to take somewhat longer but prospects for the euro-area should improve during the year. the receding of negative tail risks in the united states and the euro area in late 2012 and early 2013, together with abundant liquidity, was an important factor behind the marked strengthening of financial markets in recent months. equity prices in oecd economies have surged, corporate bond spreads have narrowed and, despite a number of negative shocks, sovereign spreads in the euro area periphery moved down substantially in the last quarter of 2012 and have declined further in 2013.this builds also on the policy actions taken in recent years, including the effect of supportive monetary policy. fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are progressing, especially in the euro area where great strides have been made to reduce structural budget deficits. albeit asymmetric, the process of euro area rebalancing is underway and competitiveness is adjusting.however, despite the recent news, the situation remains fragile and a sustainable recovery is yet to be secured.in the euro area, the on-going deep recessions in italy and spain - as well as the virtual standstill in france – raise serious questions about the recovery and remain a threat to the achievement of fiscal consolidation plans and the stability of the financial system. within the euro area, there is a renewed divergence between growth in germany, which is likely to achieve moderate growth in the first half of 2013, and that of other countries, which is projected to remain slow or negative.labour market slack remains substantial in many oecd countries, and the employment situation has continued to deteriorate in the euro area, contributing to depressed consumer confidence. in europe especially, the rise of long-term unemployment, with more of the unemployed moving off unemployment insurance onto less generous social benefits, is worsening poverty and inequality. even in the united states, where job growth has been reasonably strong in recent quarters, the proportion of the working-age population in employment remains well below pre-crisis levels and has risen only slightly from its post-crisis lows. in japan, the unemployment rate has been declining since mid-2009, but is still higher than in 2007.there is also a risk that global imbalances and financial stability issues have not been addressed adequately and problems will emerge again as the economy picks up. in most advanced economies, banks’ efforts to repair balance sheets remain ongoing. this is holding back loan growth. bank lending has recently picked up somewhat in the united states, the united kingdom and switzerland. but in the euro area, it has continued to contract, even before the hit to confidence from the drawn-out resolution of the banking crisis in cyprus. the fragmentation and fragility of the banking system remains fundamentally at the heart of weak credit availability and low growth in the eurozone. this is of great concern as the european economy is much more dependent on bank finance than the us economy. and the euro area remains the region where negative tail risks appear most prominent, because feedback loops between banking system fragility and government debt burdens have not been severed. a full banking union is needed for the euro area, not just for the future but also to get the economy moving again.financing of long-term investment is made difficult not only by the lack of banking credit but also by the rarefaction of equity finance. with the compression of yields, the preference for debt-financing has increased at the expense of equity, which is essential for the financing of long-term investment, especially for new ventures and high-growth innovative firms. furthermore, in an environment of weak sales growth and high uncertainty, corporates have been hoarding cash and privileging dividends and share buybacks at the expense of investment. this is particularly noticeable in some key sectors like technology and healthcare. in this uncertain post-crisis environment, companies that give cash back to shareholders tend to be favoured by equity markets, punishing companies that embark on long-term investment.more generally, global financial markets show signs of renewed exuberance that is increasingly out of line with fundamentals. this gaping disconnect between the financial sector and the real economy should be a source of concern. in particular, large banks’ business models have not changed enough from the pre-crisis era. banks remain over-reliant on trading activities and derivatives. in light of the recent compression of yields, a sharp correction in debt markets cannot be ruled out that would worsen the already fragile financial situation of many banks in oecd countries, in the euro-area in particular. also, markets in some emerging economies show signs of overheating and are witnessing worrying credit booms.as a self-sustained recovery is not fully assured, bold policy action to support activity remains necessary in all major oecd economies. demand in many countries still faces strong headwinds from private-sector deleveraging, necessary fiscal consolidation and impaired bank credit provision.given limited fiscal space in most oecd countries, monetary policy remains a key instrument for supporting demand, even though monetary stimulus may not always be sufficient to close output gaps quickly and carries its own risks. in some economies, especially within the euro area, the transmission of monetary easing to the real economy is impaired. notwithstanding the risk of fuelling asset price bubbles or of policy encouraging excessive risk-taking, in most major oecd economies low underlying inflation rates give room for monetary policy action, and exceptional measures should remain in place for now and in some cases be pursued further.in the united states, the real economy appears to be responding to monetary easing, as household consumption has picked up and the housing sector has begun to rebound, despite fiscal headwinds. the forward guidance from the federal reserve, whereby policy rates will be kept low as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 per cent and projected inflation remains below 2½ per cent, appears well judged in current circumstances, providing assurance that monetary conditions will be supportive of demand while it is needed. as to quantitative easing, the point where the costs of further increasing the pace of asset purchases outweigh the benefits is likely to be within sight, but skilful judgement will be required to gauge the speed at which asset purchases can be phased out.in japan, the prospect of more aggressive monetary easing had already resulted in a 20% depreciation of the yen in real effective terms and a surge in equity prices even before the recent announcement from the bank of japan which specified details of the measures to be adopted in order to meet the new 2% inflation target. the boldness of the moves have boosted confidence and improved the chances of escaping from deflation and achieving more satisfactory output growth.further measures to repair the credit transmission mechanism are most needed in the euro area, especially in crisis countries where there are strong headwinds from private and public deleveraging and there is a need to reorient economies to export activities. rapid progress must be made to implement a comprehensive system of common banking supervision with clear crisis resolution and support mechanisms, as part of a process of returning banks to good health. the recent cypriot crisis, while an exceptional case, shows the importance of addressing banking crises directly and decisively, but also of putting in place the right institutions at the euro area level to maintain banking system stability.reforms to the global financial systemat their meeting in moscow in february g20 finance ministers and central bank governors recognised that long-term financing for investment is a key contributor to economic growth and job creation the oecd will prepare a report on “high-level principles of long-term investment financing by institutional investors” for the g20 leaders summit in september 2013.regarding financial reforms, progress has been made but perhaps not as fast and as coordinated as many may have hoped for. the pressure for reforms is weakening, and against a background of weak economies and fragile banking sectors, regulators have eased some of the planned reforms, in particular those concerning the liquidity rules. there are in fact many unfinished issues on the financial reform agenda, including harmonising accounting rules to enhance transparency; introducing a simple, binding leverage ratio in the basel rules; and finding ways to better limit contagion and address the too-big-to-fail problem by structural banking reforms, e.g. the separation and ring-fencing of banks’ activities.there are also recurrent discussions at the international level pertaining to the merits of introducing restrictions on capital flows, notably aimed at taming massive inflows of short-term capital and preventing a massive appreciation in the exchange rate of the domestic currency. these discussions are legitimate, but should not lead to uncoordinated and beggar-thy-neighbour policy actions. for more than fifty years, the oecd codes of liberalisation of capital movements and current invisible operations have provided a framework for promoting transparency and mutual accountability, sharing experiences with progressive liberalisation, and supporting countries at times of economic and financial disturbance. the codes can play a role when countries need to take measures to ensure financial stability, with a variety of provisions enabling countries to introduce restrictions on capital flows. at the same time, restrictions should not be used to substitute for exchange rate and other needed policy adjustments. moreover, it is important that restrictive measures are taken within an agreed framework of international dialogue and cooperation so as to avoid negative spillover effects and entering into a spiral of measures and countermeasures. the codes offer such a framework. since june 2012 they are open to adherence by all interested countries outside the oecd membership with equal rights as oecd countries. this is an important step in expanding international co-operation, maintaining deep liquid global capital markets, and making the most of international capital flows as a tool to finance growth and development. time has also come to think about how the codes should be improved to ensure we can continue to maximise the benefits from open capital markets while avoiding their downside effects.the economic and financial crisis continues to cast its long shadow on the labour market, with many countries facing high levels of unemployment and underemployment as well as rising long-term unemployment. youth, the low-skilled and immigrants have been hit the hardest, but no group has been spared. restarting the jobs machine remains therefore essential.the first response should be to restore confidence and growth, so as to stimulate job creation. however, it is also essential to ensure that effective support is provided to the unemployed and those at risk of falling into poverty and exclusion. governments should also undertake structural reforms aimed at strengthening formal sector job creation and improving job quality. the oecd welcomes the joint meeting of the g20 finance and labour ministers, which will be an opportunity to discuss mutually reinforcing actions on the macroeconomic, labour market and social policy fronts to support stronger, sustainable growth and better employment outcomes.even countries facing severe fiscal constraints can be smarter in designing labour market policies and targeting support to the individuals most in need using cost effective measures. for example, hiring subsidies should be targeted at helping the most disadvantaged groups — such as the long-term unemployed and out-of-work youth — back into jobs, while avoiding subsidising jobs that would have been created anyway. a number of countries have also demonstrated the value of work experience programmes for keeping these groups connected to the world of work, for example the jovenes programmes in several latin american countries. publicly subsidised training programmes can also play a useful role provided they are closely coordinated with employers to assure that training meets existing skill needs.structural labour market reforms also have a role to play. several european countries, notably greece, italy, portugal and spain, have embarked on ambitious labour market reforms recently. if fully implemented, they will encourage the creation of more and better quality jobs and improve the chances of many, including the youth and other new entrants to the labour market. but especially given the difficult labour market context, special attention should be given to supporting the most vulnerable groups in the transition. moreover, these reforms should be accompanied by competition-enhancing product market reforms in service sectors, such as retail trade and professional services. tax simplification and extensions of social insurance coverage are among the measures that can help to tackle high rates of informality in many emerging and developing economies.in some cases, structural factors that contributed to the crisis and led to growing external imbalances have yet to be fully addressed. meanwhile, the depth and duration of the crisis have resulted in higher overall and especially long-term unemployment, while policy responses to restore growth have saddled many advanced economies with heavy public debt burdens. in these circumstances, structural reform will have a large role to play in achieving stronger, more sustainable and fairer growth.many oecd countries have the potential to reduce costly distortions in the tax system and widen the tax base. in the euro area and japan, there is scope to reduce restrictive product market regulations that limit competition and hold back investment. regulatory and institutional barriers to labour market participation as well as labour market dualism should be reduced, while improving programmes to help the unemployed find work. some euro area countries need to use structural reforms to reduce relative unit labour costs to reverse earlier losses in competitiveness, allowing them to achieve both internal and external balance. in some cases, this process is well underway, which is welcome. structural reforms are generally less well advanced among euro area countries with current account surpluses, and more active reforms in these countries could help reconcile the need for rebalancing with a resumption of growth in the euro area as a whole.emerging market economies are also confronting many challenges, which vary across countries, but common themes include weak innovation, high barriers to competition, inefficient education or health systems, a high degree of informality in the labour market, and low-quality infrastructure. removing these bottlenecks would help to secure strong, sustainable and inclusive growth in these countries while also helping to reduce global imbalances.more must be done to facilitate trade and integration into global value chains. adopting a liberal trade and investment regime and a pro-competitive regulatory stance in key service sectors will be essential for countries, both advanced and emerging, to maximise the benefits from the internationalisation of services markets.substantial progress is being made on structural reform in some countries. notably, while growth in the euro area has continued to disappoint, the underlying rebalancing of the economy is well underway, even if it still has some way to go. structural reforms, notably in greece, ireland, italy, portugal and spain, provide a solid base for a recovery in competitiveness and an increase in employment when demand turns around. considerable progress has been made on reducing structural budget deficits, and in most euro area countries the largest part of the fiscal adjustment required after the crisis has already been undertaken. the short-term costs of these adjustments would be reduced by an improved supply of credit in debtor countries and structural reforms that help to rebalance activity and demand in surplus economies.
915@The determinants of informality in Mexico’s states@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k483jrvnjq2-en@informality has important implications for productivity, economic growth, and the inequality of income. in recent years, the extent of informal employment has increased in many of mexico's states, though highly heterogeneously. the substantial differences across states in terms of informal employment can be helpful in explaining differences in economic growth outcomes. this paper studies the determinants of informal employment using states' diverging outcomes to identify causal factors, taking into account potential endogeneity. the results suggest that multiple factors explain differences in informal employment across states, including per capita income, the quality of labour skills, differences in the prevalence of microenterprises, the cost to start a business, restrictions on foreign investment, the rule of law and incidence of corruption.
916@Legal reform, contract enforcement and firm size in Mexico@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k483jscn8s8-en@legal systems provide the basic institutions for firms and markets to operate. their quality can have important consequences on the size distribution of firms, who rely on them for contract enforcement. this paper uses the variation in legal system quality across states in mexico to examine the relationship between judicial quality and firm size. although the country has a single legal system, its implementation and procedures vary widely, while development outcomes there are more imbalanced and unequal than in any other country of the oecd. the effect of the legal system on inter-state firm efficiency is therefore examined. building on laeven and woodruff (2007), this study uses economic census microdata and contract enforcement ratings to examine the impact of state-level legal institutions on firm and industrylevel outcomes. a robust effect of judicial quality is observed on the firm size distribution and efficiency, instrumenting for underlying historical determinants of institutions. indicative evidence is found that the effect is strongest in more capital-intensive industries. market size and distance-to-market are also found to matter for firm size outcomes, consistent with the new trade literature.
917@Improving the economic situation of young people in France@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4840dqcbjc-en@the economic situation of young people is unsatisfactory. educational inequalities have been widening for over a decade, due to a sharp decline in the results of the most highly disadvantaged students. the unemployment rate for the 20-24 age bracket has not dropped below 16% for nearly 30 years. french youth are highly pessimistic about the future and express great distrust of institutions. the social safety net sits uneasily between autonomy and family solidarity and is unfair because young people who are unemployed and have no solid financial backing from their families find themselves in precarious situations. positive discrimination in education policies should be given a real priority and education spending rationalised to draw more resources to primary schooling. the autonomy of universities should be increased, as should the financial independence of young people. the workings of the labour market, some features of which penalise new entrants, need to be reformed and youth employment services enhanced. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic review of france (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/france).
918@Green Growth Knowledge Platform 2013 annual conference@http://www.oecd.org/economy/ggkp2013annualconference.htm@"the second ggkp annual conference in 2013 will focus on private sector implementation aspects of green growth in areas of mutual interest to advanced, emerging and developing countries. the conference will bring together a dynamic mix of private sector representatives, policymakers and academics from around the world, with participation from oecd secretary-general angel gurría and unep executive director achim steiner. the ggkp conference will stir discussions to identify the opportunities as well as challenges to spread the economic benefits of green growth throughout the global economy and contribute to the achievement of countries’ development objectives. it will communicate fresh ideas from recent policy research to help countries shape their green growth policies that are simultaneously environmentally effective, cost-efficient and socially inclusive. ""the oecd is excited to be a part of this growing green community of practice. the ggkp is an important forum to initiate and coordinate collaborative green growth analysis and studies. in this vein, the oecd is looking forward to hosting the 2013 annual ggkp conference on 4-5 april.” oecd deputy secretary-general rintaro tamakithe first day of the conference will discuss policy measures and tools that provide the right incentives for “greening” global value chains. it will focus on corporate initiatives to account for environmental concerns and improve the performance through enhanced integration in the value chain. global value chains (gvcs) refer to the concept that the whole process of producing goods, from raw materials to finished products, has increasingly been “sliced” and each process can now be carried out wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive cost. these global value chains are now experiencing a new trend towards greener products. the move towards greener gvcs has opene‌d an array of opportunities for stronger integration in global value chains by sharing tasks and enabling markets in sustainable goods and services in emerging and developing countries.the second day of the conference will look at corporate initiatives to develop measurement and reporting tools to take into account the impact on the environment. indeed, addressing environmental pressures and achieving green growth pose measurement challenges to both firms and governments. it will, therefore, explore such challenges arising in developing and in developed countries, and will also cover government efforts to provide a framework for monitoring the greening of economic activities. this will be an opportunity for both government and business representatives to assess the possibilities to work more closely together in aligning the key metrics which will govern policy development and corporate reporting.• moving towards a common approach on green growth indicatorsa green growth knowledge platform scoping papergggi, oecd, unep and the world bank (april 2013)• building green global value chains - committed public-private coalitions in agro-commodity marketsidh the sustainable trade initiative, in collaboration with the dutch sustainable growth coalition and ernst & young• greening global value chains: innovation and the international diffusion of technologies and knowledgematthieu glachant (mines paristech)• private sector initiatives on measuring and reporting on green growthdr. nancy kamp-roelands (ernst & young)the ggkp work is highly complementary to the oecds green growth strategy. a range of resources is available via the oecd website, such as information on green growth indicators, specific country application of green growth policies, as well as the latest reports and publications that make up both the green growth studies and paper series. please visit our website for this as well as more news relevant to green growth: www.oecd.org/greengrowth/ furthermore, reporting and measurement plays a significant part in all oecd work. the oecd towards green growth: monitoring progress report was launched as part of the green growth strategy, and this is becoming part of country initiatives on green growth, such as with korea, the netherlands, the czech republic, germany and denmark,, who have all issued reports based on the above publication. mexico, the slovak republic and slovenia as well as colombia, costa rica, ecuador, guatemala, paraguay, and peru in the lac region and a few eastern european and east-asian countries are now also using the oecd indicators’ framework to support their respective national efforts ."
919@Improving employment prospects for young workers in Spain@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k487n7hg08s-en@the unemployment rate among young people has reached painfully high levels, in particular among those young people with low levels of education. there are two crucial policy priorities to improve employment prospects for youth in spain. first, in the very short term, there is need for quick action to target welldesigned active labour market programmes to the most disadvantaged youth and provide more job-search assistance and guidance for all youth experiencing difficulties in finding a job in the current labour market. second, the current crisis is an opportunity to tackle some of the structural weaknesses in the spanish youth labour market. this implies in particular reforms to prevent youth from dropping out of education at a very early stage and to improve the school to work transition of young people. key issues are to better match skills acquired in education to those asked for by businesses, as well as to establish an effective system of vocational education, and to reduce remaining demand side barriers, notably labour market duality and a rigid collective bargaining system, which both have prevented an efficient allocation of labour resources in the past and a flexible adjustment during the crisis. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of spain (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/spain).
920@Youth labour market performance in Spain and its determinants - a micro-level perspective@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k487n5bfz5c-en@this paper provides both descriptive and empirical evidence about the main youth labour market problems in spain. using the experiences of other eu economies as a benchmark, we document the performance of spain as regards a wide set of youth labour market dimensions. these include employment and unemployment rates, youth wages, decisions to work and study, youth mobility, type of employment contract, time to find a first job, skill mismatch, etc. cross-country econometric evidence from different micro-datasets is reported to understand the role played by several underlying supply/demand factors which might explain the difficulties faced by the spanish youth labour market (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/spain).
921@The efficiency and equity of the tax and transfer system in France@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k487n4jqqg5-en@the efficiency and equity of the tax and transfer system in francetaxes and cash transfers reduce income inequality more in france than elsewhere in the oecd, because of the large size of the flows involved. but the system is complex overall. its effectiveness could be enhanced in many ways, for example so as to achieve the same amount of redistribution at lower cost. the french tax code should be simplified and changed less frequently. high statutory rates are coupled with a wide range of effective tax rates resulting from a multitude of tax expenditures. there is a need for base broadening combined with lower rates throughout the system, including vat. the tax wedge on labour is high, except at the bottom of the wage distribution, which can reduce worker participation and job offers. greater neutrality both across different capital asset classes but also within specific taxes, and shifting taxes from labour and capital inputs to environmental and property taxes would improve economic outcomes. likewise, the system of social and family benefits should be simplified to enhance transparency and consistency. eliminating schemes that let people leave the labour market early, abolishing the pension privileges of specific occupational groups and internalising the costs of survivors’ pension benefits would increase fairness while at the same time generating savings. better labour-market performance would result from increasing job-search incentives and shortening the parental leave allowance. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of france (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/france).j20: labor and demographic economics / demand and supply of labor / demand and supply of labor: general; h70: public economics / state and local government; intergovernmental relations / state and local government; intergovernmental relations: general; h20: public economics / taxation, subsidies, and revenue / taxation, subsidies, and revenue: general; h30: public economics / fiscal policies and behavior of economic agents / fiscal policies and behavior of economic agents: general; d30: microeconomics / distribution / distribution: general; h55: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies / social security and public pensions; h50: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies / national government expenditures and related policies: general; j30: labor and demographic economics / wages, compensation, and labor costs / wages, compensation, and labor costs: general
922@Income inequality and poverty in Colombia. Part 2. The redistributive impact of taxes and transfers@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k487n4r0t8s-en@income inequality in colombia has declined since the early 2000s but remains very high by international standards. while most of the inequality originates from the labour market, wealth – and thus capital income – is also highly concentrated and the tax and transfer system has little redistributive impact. the tax-to-gdp ratio remains low. consumption taxes, which tend to be regressive, account for the bulk. the progressivity of income taxes had been undermined by generous tax reliefs, which benefit the well-off most and increase tax avoidance opportunities. the tax system should be reformed to enhance progressivity and raise more revenue which could be used to expand social policies. cash transfers to households are small and dominated by non-redistributive schemes such as contributory pensions. education coverage has increased steadily but quality and equity in access at the tertiary level remain important issues. though significant progress has been made towards universal health coverage, the financing and organisation of the health care system could be improved to raise the quality of care and reduce adverse incentives to remain in the informal sector.
923@Income inequality and poverty in Colombia. Part 1. The role of the labour market@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k487n74s1f1-en@income inequality and poverty in colombia - part 1. the role of the labour marketincome inequality in colombia has declined since the early 2000s but remains very high by international standards. income dispersion largely originates from the labour market, which is characterised by a still high unemployment rate, a pervasive informal sector and a wide wage dispersion reflecting a large education premium for those with higher education. reducing income inequality is a key government objective and this requires improving the performance of the labour market. raising educational outcomes for all and enhancing training programmes would help improve labour supply and productivity. formal job creation however remains heavily constrained by restrictive labour market regulations, in particular very substantial non-wage labour costs and a minimum wage which is high compared to average incomes. the 2012 tax reform reduces non-wage labour costs but more decisive steps are needed to create the right conditions and incentives to boost formal employment.j16: labor and demographic economics / demographic economics / economics of gender; non-labor discrimination; i24: health, education, and welfare / education and research institutions / education and inequality; i32: health, education, and welfare / welfare, well-being, and poverty / measurement and analysis of poverty; o17: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth / economic development / formal and informal sectors; shadow economy; institutional arrangements; j3: labor and demographic economics / wages, compensation, and labor costs; o5: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth / economywide country studies; i3: health, education, and welfare / welfare, well-being, and poverty; j2: labor and demographic economics / demand and supply of labor; h23: public economics / taxation, subsidies, and revenue / taxation and subsidies: externalities; redistributive effects; environmental taxes and subsidies; h52: public economics / national government expenditures and related policies / government expenditures and education
924@Together We Stand: Inclusive Growth@http://www.oecd.org/economy/together-we-stand-inclusive-growth.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at an oecd workshop on inclusive growth(as prepared for delivery)paris, 3rd april 2013 welcome to the oecd workshop on inclusive growth! we are pleased to see such a diverse turnout at what i hope will be a meaningful discussion. i would like to thank the ford foundation, our partner, for their support. thank you, president ubiñas and the ford team.and, thank you zeinab, for joining us today.to set the stage for the workshop, we have prepared a short video, which we will present right now.to quote the short film, “for inclusive growth, you need inclusive debate,” and that is what we are here to do.the discussions on inclusive growth today couldn’t be more timely. the global community is demanding relief from the suffocating economic crisis and a promise for a more equitable future. and i don’t blame them, the facts are alarming:unemployment: worldwide, there are more than 200 million people who are out of work. the oecd-wide unemployment rate stands at 8% – that’s equivalent to around 48 million people out of work – almost 15 million more than when the financial crisis began at the end of 2007. in countries like spain and greece, it exceeds 25%. and regrettably the forecast is grim. youth unemployment is at least double the national averages in most countries.inequalities: today, the gap between rich and poor is widening almost everywhere. within oecd countries, it is now the widest in 30 years: the average income of the richest 10% of the population is about 9 times that of the poorest 10%, as opposed to 7 times 30 years ago. in the united states, israel and turkey the inequality gap can reach up to 14 to 1, with even more discouraging ratios – 27 to 1 – in chile and mexico. even traditionally egalitarian countries have witnessed growing income inequalities, which are also widening in china, india, south africa, as well as in many developing countries.poverty: despite real progress, poverty remains a reality in many countries. in sub-saharan africa, almost half of the population still lives on less than usd 1.25 per day. and india, an emerging, fast-growing economy, is home to one-third of the world’s poor. we just have to look on the streets to see that even prosperous societies are not escaping poverty. it’s on the rise, and makes up to 20% of the population in israel, mexico and turkey, and 15% in the us, spain, japan and korea. there are still a billion people – one seventh of humanity – who go to bed hungry every night.the truth is that our economic growth models have not equitably distribute benefits. inequalities were brewing under the surface prior to 2007 and increased almost everywhere even during periods of sustained economic growth. we need to reverse this trend.inclusive growth has an important role to play in responding to the pressing needs of today and addressing the underlying trends that pushed our economic and social systems into disequilibrium.but first, the concept needs be clarified. presently, it means different things to different people and in different countries – advanced, emerging, and developing. an important part of our job today is to shed more light on how inclusive growth can be defined.second, inclusive growth is also about distribution. it is about looking at how the benefits and opportunities of growth are shared among social groups. and it is about making growth sustainable for future generations: how can we assure that our children and our youth who now face dire conditions will enjoy a better future?third, inclusive growth is about putting in place better policies for better lives:this is our primary objective! what we need is a manageable, measurable, comparable concept that can lead to smart policies that are pro-growth and pro-inclusiveness at the same time. this is about understanding the trade-offs among policies, and how they can be reconciled. it is also about taking into account countries’ specific levels of development.finally, we need to ensure that this is about making inclusive growth reform happen!we cannot design, promote and even less put in place a plan, without consulting all the stakeholders. that’s why we are here today.we are now in a period of reflection – and hopefully enlightenment – where we can draw lessons from the crisis and propose solutions for the future and where we can also look at the unintended consequences of our policy choices. new approaches to economic challenges, what we refer to as naec here at the oecd, are in demand. and inclusive growth is central to naec: it is about looking for new approaches, and it is about addressing economic and social challenges. actually, in our naec exercise, we are mandated to develop a comprehensive agenda for sustainable inclusive growth.to make the inclusive growth reform agenda happen, we must continue to refine a policy-oriented conceptual framework and act on it!building on our work of today and on subsequent consultations with all stakeholders, we will host a second workshop at the end of the year. i count on your participation and contributions again.president ubiñas, let me say again that is a pleasure to collaborate with the ford foundation on this important project.i would like to commend the ford foundation for its commitment over the last 70+ years to combatting poverty and improving the lives and well-being of people all over the world. we are very proud to join forces with the foundation in this and in many other partnerships.please luis, i invite you to share your remarks (read the speech by luis ubinas, president of the ford foundation).>> for more information about oecd work on inclusive growth, please visit: www.oecd.org/inclusive-growth
925@Global economy is improving but Europe lags behind, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/global-economy-is-improving-but-europe-lags-behind.htm@>> watch the webcast of the press conference28/03/2013 - global economic activity is picking up, but the continuing crisis in the euro area is delaying a meaningful recovery, the oecd said in its latest interim economic assessment.the assessment, presented in paris by chief economist pier carlo padoan, says that the g7 economies are expected to grow at an annualised 2.4 per cent rate in the first quarter of 2013 and at a 1.8 percent rate in the second. it notes that financial markets are out-pacing real activity, which has been held back by weak business and consumer confidence, and highlights the risk that asset prices may rise beyond levels justified by fundamentals.“the global economy weakened in late 2012 but the outlook is now improving for oecd economies,” mr padoan said. “bold policy action remains necessary to ensure a more sustainable recovery, particularly in the euro area, where growth is uneven and remains slower than in other regions. (see his powerpoint presentation)”the oecd projects that the euro area’s three largest economies – germany, france and italy – will grow by 0.4 per cent during the first quarter and by an additional 1 per cent in the second, but points to a renewed divergence between growth in germany and the euro area economies. the german economy is expected to grow by 2.3 per cent in the first quarter and by 2.6 per cent in the second. the french economy is expected to see a 0.6 per cent contraction in the first quarter followed by a 0.5 per cent rebound in the second. in italy, real gdp is expected to drop by 1.6 per cent in the first quarter and by an additional 1 per cent in the second.weak growth and low confidence are expected to com‌plicate efforts to bring down high unemployment rates across much of europe.“the employment situation continues to deteriorate in many countries, making it all the more urgent to implement the labour and product market reforms that can stimulate growth and create jobs,” mr padoan said.growth in the united states was held back by one-off factors in the fourth quarter of 2012, but the economy is expected to see a rebound of 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013 before returning to moderate growth of 2.0 per cent in the second. canada is set to grow by 1.1 per cent during the first quarter and 1.9 per cent during the second.growth in japan is projected to accelerate from previous low levels to a 3.2 per cent pace during the first quarter and 2.2 per cent in the second, while the united kingdom is expected to grow by 0.5 percent during the first quarter and 1.4 percent in the second.monetary stimulus remains necessary but needs vary across countries. “in the united states, the commitment of the federal reserve to keep policy rates low until labour market outcomes improve substantially is well judged, but the need for further exceptional monetary measures is waning, while in japan more aggressive policy action is required to escape deflation and achieve the bank of japan’s new 2% inflation target,” mr padoan said.“in the euro area, there is still some scope to ease monetary policy further, given weak demand and inflation well below the ecb’s objective, while further action is needed to repair the transmission mechanism. ”for more information on the interim economic assessment, see: www.oecd.org/oecdeconomicoutlook.journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 97 00).
926@Speeding up reforms will foster more inclusive and greener growth in China@http://www.oecd.org/economy/speedingupreformswillfostermoreinclusiveandgreenergrowthinchina.htm@"22/03/2013 - china has made tremendous progress toward achieving inclusive growth, but major reforms are needed to ensure a fourth decade of rapidly converging living standards and a greener economy, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of china.these reforms include deregulating interest rates, opening markets dominated by state-owned enterprises to competition, increasing the supply of building land, treating migrants to cities in an even-handed fashion, taxing carbon and deregulating energy prices. full implementation of these reforms will foster socially inclusive urbanisation, a key to a continued rise in domestic demand.maintain prudent macroeconomic management. monetary policy can remain relatively accommodative in the near term, but it should be forward-looking and guard against inflation risks. china should deal with the off-budget liabilities of local government financing platforms and substantially raise the annual quotas for new building land, to reduce pressure on property prices.move ahead on financial sector reforms. china should continue moving toward market-determined interest rates and align the regulation of bond markets for long maturities with market practices for shorter ones. quotas for inward investment in equities and long-dated bonds should progressively increase, while allowing for greater use of offshore renminbi deposits in mainland china and greater exchange rate flexibility.strengthen policies to boost competition and innovation. rules for opening new sectors to private investment - including foreign investment - should be clarified and the time needed to register a new business reduced. improving the effectiveness of r&d spending and tightening enforcement of intellectual property rights will boost innovation.make urbanisation more inclusive. sufficient resources must be devoted to public transportation and local public services, for them to be provided to all residents. schooling should be on an equal basis for all. migrants should be allowed to enroll in high schools and take university entrance exams where their parents live. local quotas for entrance to university should be abolished.move toward greener growth. further improvement is needed in energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gdp, with carbon taxation preferable to emissions trading. energy conservation should be encouraged, through higher excise duties on gasoline and deregulated prices. water prices should be raised for end-users, and levies and pollution taxes increased. standards for motor vehicle emissions and fuel quality should be further tightened.china participates in a broad range of oecd work, alongside other key partners brazil, india, indonesia and south africa. the peer review process behind the oecd’s economic surveys is a key oecd contribution to the g20’s framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.further information on the economic survey of china is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/china-2013.htm. you are invited to include this link in coverage.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd’s media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00.more information about the secretary-general’s official visit to china"

928@France must do more to boost competitiveness and create jobs@http://www.oecd.org/economy/france-must-do-more-to-boost-competitiveness-and-create-jobs.htm@"19/03/2013 - france has avoided the most severe impacts of the global economic crisis and turmoil in the euro area, but must now take action to boost competitiveness and create jobs, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of france.the survey, presented in paris by oecd secretary-general angel gurría to french minister of economy and finance pierre moscovici, urges france to attack the pervasive bottlenecks that have limited economic growth and maintained high unemployment over the past decades. “the french economy has tremendous assets and considerable potential, but excessive regulation and high levels of taxation are gradually eroding its competitiveness,” mr gurria said.“france has a unique opportunity today to implement a bold and ambitious reform strategy that will restore public finances, create jobs and boost firms’ competitiveness. a more productive and more competitive french economy is not only a national goal, but an important element of a stronger europe,” mr gurria said.while congratulating the french government for significant progress in the past months, the oecd identifies several priority areas for action: bolster the economy’s potential growth rate. reductions in public spending are required to rein in the budget deficit and allow for lower taxes on labour and business income - a key element in future competitiveness plans. labour market reforms - including a new definition of economic dismissal, simplified layoff procedures, and more effective occupational training and job search assistance - are needed to boost job creation. in this sense, the recent labour agreement with social partners is welcome. greater competition in services and rationalisation of housing policies will be crucial to raise purchasing power, create jobs and enhance competitiveness.tax and transfer system reforms are essential. the size, complexity and instability of the tax and transfer system weigh on the economy, and require thorough simplification. savings are taxed very differently depending on asset classes. tax bases, notably for vat, are narrow. reforms to unemployment benefits would save costs and promote employment.staying the course on improving public finances is necessary. efforts to reduce the structural deficit must continue as planned. public spending is very high as a percentage of gdp and needs to be reduced, to ease the tax burden in the medium term.the difficulties facing young people call for wide-ranging actions. replacing the many income-support programmes with an extension of the minimum income scheme to young adults would reduce youth poverty, but this must be accompanied by stronger requirements to train, search for and accept work. france’s high minimum wage tends to exclude the least educated youths from jobs. the transition from school to work is indicative not only of weaknesses in the labour market, but also of an education system that distributes resources poorly, generates dropouts and suffers from a still too fragmented and tightly controlled tertiary system. further information on the economic survey of france is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/france-2013.htm. you are invited to include this link in coverage.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd’s media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."
929@Strengthening social cohesion in Luxembourg: making efficiency and equity go hand in hand@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/strengthening-social-cohesion-in-luxembourg_5k49lcrgv2g4-en@luxembourg is a rich and fast-growing country. however, inequality of disposable incomes has trended up modestly over the past decades and relative poverty has risen reflecting mainly the rapid growth of high incomes. the relatively high inequality of market incomes is substantially reduced by large social transfers, but the risk of relative poverty still affects the most vulnerable, such as the young, the less educated, single parents and migrants. at the same time the generous transfer systems tend to reduce work incentives. there is significant room for improvement in the design of the tax and transfer system to enhance work incentives and improve targeting, particularly for the less skilled workers. reforms that tackle poverty traps would both reduce inequality and improve the labour supply of residents. strong activation policies are important in getting people to jobs. job opportunities would also be enhanced by improving education outcomes for pupils from low socio-economic backgrounds and for secondgeneration immigrants. reducing high repetition rates and better targeting education spending to schools with high shares of vulnerable students would help improve outcomes.
930@Labour market, welfare reform and inequality in the United Kingdom@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/labour-market-welfare-reform-and-inequality-in-the-united-kingdom_5k49lcnl9cr8-en@employment has risen by more and unemployment has risen less than expected, given the path of output. nevertheless, long-term and youth unemployment and involuntary part-time work are high. a polarised labour market risks worsening income inequality, which is high by oecd standards, despite a recent and likely temporary decline. the uk welfare system is an essential safety net, which needs to promote employment, while protecting the most vulnerable. the reformed welfare system, universal credit, and the employment programme for disadvantaged workers, work programme, will generally improve work incentives and provide support for return to work, but need to be refined. skill deficiencies are holding back employment and fostering inequality, as low education achievements penalise children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. vocational training needs to be strengthened and cooperation with employers reinforced. transition from education to work can prove challenging, requiring more attention to the integration of university graduates into the labour market.
931@Work incentives and Universal Credit – reform of the benefit system in the United Kingdom@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/work-incentives-and-universal-credit_5k49lcn89rkf-en@under the universal credit reform, the main means-tested benefits except the council tax benefit will be pooled into one single benefit with one single taper rate. the reform will give people better incentives to work, reduce complexity and contribute to reducing poverty. the reform could reduce the number of workless households by between 45 000 and 240 000 and increase labour supply by the equivalent of 15 000-85 000 full-time employees. increased take-up and increased entitlements for low income families will further reduce poverty and increase equality. however, the cost of childcare remains high even after taking childcare benefits into account. despite significant improvements, childcare expenses will continue to be a hurdle to progress in work for second earners and lone parents, even after the universal credit reform.
932@Policy options to durably resolve euro area imbalances@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/policy-options-to-durably-resolve-euro-area-imbalances_5k49lcnzkn20-en@a simple econometric framework is presented linking current account balances of euro area countries to intra and extra euro area competitiveness, cyclical positions, fiscal positions and the oil price. the framework is then used to cyclically-adjust observed current account balances and illustrate the scale of the additional adjustments to competitiveness and/or fiscal balances required in the euro area periphery to bring structural current account balances to levels compatible with sustainable net external debt levels. in spain and portugal, cost competitiveness relative to the rest of the euro area would need to improve by about 30%, and by more than twice that in greece. in peripheral countries, a combination of structural reforms to boost productivity and enhance the flexibility of labour markets, ambitious fiscal consolidation and reductions in labour taxes could substantially facilitate the rebalancing process and reduce the extent to which the burden of adjustment is reliant on further prolonged demand weakness. surplus and/or strong competitiveness countries could help by likewise making labour and product markets more flexible, accepting above-normal inflation for an extended period and boosting demand, perhaps through reduced fiscal austerity.
933@Mineral Resource Trade in Chile: Contribution to Development and Policy Implications@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/mineral-resource-trade-in-chile_5k4bw6twpf24-en@mineral resources present a formidable source of wealth but a formidable challenge to regulate in order to maximize social welfare from their extraction. some resource-rich countries, such as chile, have been successful in developing their economies and managing their revenue streams effectively. strong institutions and regulatory oversight have helped to capitalize on the benefits of the mining sector for economy-wide growth and development in chile. this paper identifies some of the good practice areas in mining regulation in chile whose economy has shown strong growth over most of the last two decades. some of the areas touched on in this paper are the taxation of the minerals sector, management of the tax revenue, and policies designed to foster spillovers into other sectors of the economy and make the most of chile’s comparative advantage as a long-time global leader in the copper industry. the paper concludes that there is much to be learned from the chilean experience in regulating its mining sector and many areas where it could be well used as a model for other mineral rich economies wishing to develop their mining sectors to enhance economy-wide growth.
934@The price of oil – will it start rising again?@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-price-of-oil-will-it-start-rising-again_5k49q186vxnp-en@following a sharp drop amidst the global economic crisis and a subsequent recovery, the spot price of crude oil has been broadly stable for the past couple of years. this paper discusses the factors that drive oil demand and supply and, hence, the price of the resource. a set of oil demand equations is estimated for oecd and non-oecd countries, which is then combined with assumptions about the behaviour of supply to analyse the impact of a range of macroeconomic and policy scenarios on the future oil price path. the scenario analysis suggests that a return of world growth to slightly below pre-crisis rates would be consistent with an increase in the price of brent crude to far above early-2012 levels by 2020. this increase would be mostly driven by higher demand from non-oecd economies – in particular china and india. the expected rise in the oil price is unlikely to be smooth. sudden changes in the supply or demand of oil can have very large effects on the price in the short run.
935@The system of revenue sharing and fiscal transfers in China@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-system-of-revenue-sharing-and-fiscal-transfers-in-china_5k4bwnwtmx0r-en@the main features of china’s current sub-national finance arrangements date back to the 1994 tax reform. china has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of tax sharing and transfers, and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. local governments have hardly any discretionary power to modify taxation, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and penalties. they can also spend the profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to central government restrictions. as the 1994 tax reform recentralised revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have grown. in order to accommodate this, the central government has raised the scale of transfers. over the past decade, china’s transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become markedly more redistributive. nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much greater than between regions in oecd countries. the extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies, thus affecting the delivery of services. the government’s plan to equalise service provision across the country therefore calls for fine-tuning the transfer system and improving local revenue. some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that would substantially raise tax revenue. a significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of land-use rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have strong budgets. this working paper relates to the 2013 oecd economic survey of china (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/china)
936@A clean energy economy - Lessons from Iceland@http://www.oecd.org/economy/a-clean-energy-economy-lessons-from-iceland.htm@speech by the president of iceland, ólafur ragnar grímssonit is a profound pleasure to return to the oecd at the invitation of my good friend and an honour to introduce a discussion on how iceland can offer lessons on the nature of a clean energy economy; and also some insights from our recent challenges in dealing with the financial crisis. in the introduction to the recent oecd publication on the environment the secretary-general describes an important initiative called “new approaches to economic challenges” and emphasizes the need for “revisiting our economic models and theories, and enriching our analytical frameworks, identifying a renewed strategic policy agenda for inclusive growth and well-being that also takes into account sustainability and the respect for the environment”. with due respect to other oecd countries i believe iceland is well placed to serve as a testing ground, as a laboratory, where the relevance of models and theories can be examined, where experience allows us to challenge prevailing orthodoxies and thus hopefully pave a clearer way to a more sustainable, prosperous and secure economic future.you are all familiar with our debacle in the fall of 2008 when our banking system collapsed but maybe few realize that up to the 1970s iceland was classified by the undp as a developing country, a nation still dominated by fishing and sheep farming, having for centuries been among the poorest in europe; the energy still primarily fossil fuel, imported oil and coal.in the decades that followed we radically transformed our energy system so now 100% of our electricity production and 100% of house heating is provided by domestic, renewable resources: hydro and geothermal. along the way the economy has become more diversified, aided by this clean energy transformation, the bases of strong aluminium and other high-tech industries, dynamic it companies, growing tourism, combined with creative culture and design and a deep-rooted welfare society, with universal healthcare and education for all, maintained even throughout the recent financial crisis.our clean energy economy helped the people of iceland to survive the banking collapse, especially because the cost of heating and electricity for ordinary families, homes and business companies is very low compared to what it is in other european countries. but also because it makes iceland an attractive location for industrial investments; for aluminium smelters, data-storage centres, high-tech industries and other thriving enterprises.thus, the first global investment decision taken by rio tinto after an interval following the fall of lehman brothers in 2008, was to modernize its aluminium smelter in iceland, and century aluminium is now in the process of building its second smelter in iceland; decisions taken because aluminium produced by clean energy maintains a strong long-term market position. similarly, the establishment of new data storage centres is helped and inspired by the supply of clean energy.it is also worth noting that the scale of our national savings resulting from geothermal house heating alone is demonstrated by the fact that every ten years iceland saves by not having to import oil and coal to heat the houses what amounts to one year’s gnp.this has indeed been a revolutionary transformation, not only allowing us to build an economy with an inherent long-term strength but also to make significant contributions to the rest of the world. the geothermal sector has now become one of the major pillars of iceland’s global position, of our foreign policy and our diplomatic efforts.the united nations geothermal training programme, founded three decades ago in iceland, has strengthened the capabilities of more than 40 developing countries and in recent years icelandic energy companies and engineering firms have participated in geothermal projects in china and india, in east-africa and central-america, in western and eastern europe, in the middle-east, russia and the united states.it has been an important task of my presidency to promote such cooperation, especially since the threat of irreversible climate changes makes it our moral duty to help others to move towards a more sustainable future.the climate crisis constitutes a call for a fundamental energy revolution, a comprehensive transformation from fossil fuel to green energy resources. coming from a country with the largest glaciers in europe, close to the frozen arctic, icelanders do not need to attend international conferences to be convinced of the accelerating rate of climate change. our own neighbourhood exhibits ample evidence that time is running out, that without a comprehensive transformation of the energy systems the entire world will already in this century face costly and dramatic consequences of severe weather events and rising sea levels.in the global debate on climate change, sustainability and energy transformation, there has been a predominant tendency to concentrate primarily on electricity production and overlook the multiple economic advantages and business opportunities derived from a clean energy economy.in this respect iceland can be of great service, inviting visitors to witness for themselves in a matter of one or two days the various aspects of a clean energy economy as well as its contribution to bringing a country within a few years out of a profound financial crisis onto a road of recovery, economy growth and low unemployment.let me, therefore, in the short time allowed list briefly a number of ways in which clean energy has strengthened and broadened the icelandic economy, making a strong practical case for a prevailing vision of sustainability; that it is indeed good for business.first. cheep electricity and heating for households and companies makes the energy bill far lower than in other countries, increasing the resources available for other expenditures and investments.second. long term access to clean energy has proven itself to be a magnet for foreign investment, e.g. aluminium and other industrial companies.third. the access to clean energy strengthens, through low carbon footprint, the global marketing position of the emerging and dynamic high-tech and it sectors since the combination of advanced technology and clean energy appeals increasingly to enlightened customers all over the world.fourth. greenhouse agriculture which diversifies the farming sector, enables us to enjoy the domestic production of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and a variety of vegetables while it also fascinates the tourists. indeed, tomato growing has been so successful that iceland could within a few years begin exporting tomatoes to europe.fifth. fish farming with geothermal heat adjusting the sea and fresh water temperatures according to the needs of different species; the most recent example being the construction of a 2,000 tons senegal sole fish farm within the reykjanes geothermal power park.sixth. tourism has benefited largely in recent decades from various spas of which the blue lagoon is the most famous example as well as from outdoor swimming pools and other lifestyle by-products of the clean energy transformation. now more than half a million tourists visit the blue lagoon every year; soon twice the total total population of the country.seventh. health and cosmetics. the chemicals in the geothermal water, have, together with the growing of barley in greenhouses, turned out to be a fertile basis for modern cosmetic and health products, proving how cutting-edge science and high-tech innovation can use the clean energy supplies for product development.eight. the drying of fish products, especially fish heads, backbones and other parts which previously were thrown away, has in the last 30 years evolved into a prosperous multi-million dollar export market; allowing the icelandic fish products to be stored in their dry form by local nigerian street vendors for up to two years without any special infrastructure; a method which i am now advocating at the global level since the drying of fish, meat, fruit and vegetables could be a major contribution to enhancing food security on every continent, especially since a large part of the food already produced in the developing world gets destroyed within a week due to the lack of proper storage methods and facilities.ninth. the potential of a zero emission urban traffic by introducing, in the coming years, electric and hydrogen vehicles using the clean energy grid already established by our utility companies.tenth. clean energy projects have strengthened the capacities of our universities and been the foundation of a strong engineering and technical sector, invigorated in the last decades of the twentieth century by various clean energy efforts and is now increasingly engaged in projects in other countries, adding science and research to our modern export endeavours.eleventh. the clean energy achievements and our multi-dimensional clean energy economy has, especially in this new century, become an expanding foundation of our foreign relations, our diplomatic, political and economic cooperation with countries in asia, africa, europe and the americas. it is the major reason why global leaders like china and india engage with my small nation and why dozens of other countries have recently opened their doors to a constructive cooperation with iceland.all of this shows in numerous ways how the transformation towards clean energy and the vision of sustainability have strengthened the icelandic economy; indeed one of the explanations for our successful recovery after the financial crisis four years ago.thus it can truly be said, based on our experience, that the development of a clean energy economy is a good insurance policy against long-term difficulties which inevitably will continue to follow the financial crises of the future; against making the downturns of economic cycles too painful.the clean energy transformation in previous decades is definitely a major dimension of our recent recovery but there are, of course, other factors which we could examine in the question session following my opening statement.among these a few are paramount:we did not follow the established financial orthodoxies of the western world since the 1980s, the so-called washington consensus. we let the private banks fail; we introduced currency controls; we protected the welfare system and to that extent rejected orthodox austerity measures.we realized early that this was not just a financial crisis, but also a profound political, democratic and even a judicial crisis. wide-ranging reforms in all these areas were needed in order to rebuild the confidence of the nation so the people could move together through the crisis towards a new road of recovery.and, when we faced the co-called icesave dispute in which the governments of the united kingdom and the netherlands, supported by all eu governments and others, demanded that the ordinary people of iceland – fishermen, farmers, teachers, nurses – should shoulder through their taxes the debts of a failed private bank – we had to choose between the financial interests as they were presented by the established leadership of europe and the democratic will of the icelandic nation and decided to allow democracy to prevail.following the two referendums, in which the people overwhelmingly voted no, the economy started to recover, becoming healthier with each quarter. the financial doomsayers, whether experts or leaders, who advised strongly against the democratic will of the people turned out to be entirely wrong in their analysis and predictions; a result which certainly should serve as a challenge to many of the policies which are still being advocated and followed in many countries.when the efta court last month ruled that there was no legal basis for the case of britain, the netherlands and the eu against iceland, it became clear that in addition to the democratic will of the people, justice and the rule of law was also on our side.
937@OECD government borrowing set to rise slightly in 2013@http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecdgovernmentborrowingsettoriseslightlyin2013.htm@27/02/2013 - the gross borrowing needs of oecd governments are projected to increase slightly to around usd 10.9 trillion in 2013, up from the already high level of usd 10.8 trillion in 2012, according to a new oecd report.the oecd sovereign borrowing outlook 2013 expects that ratings agencies will continue to keep the pressure on governments in 2013. given their poor track record of sovereign risk pricing over the past twenty years, the report suggests that any downgrades should be carefully scrutinized, and not taken at face value.the general government deficit for the oecd area as a whole is estimated to have reached 5.5% of gdp in 2012, equivalent to around usd 2.6 trillion. it is projected to decrease to 4.6% of gdp in 2013, equivalent to around usd 2.3 trillion.government debt ratios for the oecd as a whole are expected to grow or remain at high levels during the coming year. general government debt-to-gdp is projected to reach 111.4% in 2013. the good news, according to the report, is that overall debt ratios are increasing much more slowly than in the past, declining from an increase of 11.5% in 2008-2009 to a projected 1.1% increase in 2013-2014.euro area-induced contagion effects in 2011 led to upward pressures on funding costs and roll-over risk for sovereigns, as well as a reduced ability by financial institutions’ to pledge sovereign securities as collateral and flight-to-safety by investors. however, the recently announced combined outright monetary transactions and european stability mechanism backstop has had a noticeable downward influence on bond yields in peripheral markets.in countries where public deficits and debt ratios have not begun to decline, the legacy of public debt exposes governments to shifts in confidence, complicating the implementation of issuance programmes by sovereigns. raising large volumes of funds at lowest cost to refinance their debt obligations will therefore remain a major challenge for many governments. most oecd debt managers will continue rebalancing their portfolios by issuing more long-term bonds and cutting back on issuance of short-term bills.many countries are expected to see a relatively high level of longer-term redemptions in 2013. for the oecd area as a whole, governments will need to refinance around 30% of outstanding long-term debt in the next three years. the oecd average long-term interest rate is expected to rise to around 4.0% in 2013, up from 3.8% in 2009.for more information, journalists should contact hans blommestein head of bond market and public debt management unit, tel.: +33-1-45247990 (fixed) or +33628710093 (mobile).
938@Do the average level and dispersion of socio-economic background measures explain France’s gap in PISA scores?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4bxkv1d96k-en@oecd’s pisa publications highlight the impact of economic, social and cultural status (escs) on students’ results within countries. the focus here is to investigate whether escs measures could contribute to differences in aggregate educational outcomes between countries. there is some evidence that, after controlling for education spending and the overall level of economic development, differences in escs might account for a substantial amount of france’s gap in average pisa scores with respect to best performing oecd countries, albeit by no means all of it.
939@Measuring Fiscal Decentralisation, Concepts and Policies@http://www.oecd.org/economy/measuring-fiscal-decentralisation-concepts-and-policies.htm@"fiscal decentralisation is notoriously difficult to measure. the common indicators such as the share of sub-central in general government spending or revenue often provide an imprecise or even misleading picture of intergovernmental fiscal frameworks. since discretion over the budget is a central aspect of fiscal autonomy, the oecd has developed a more refined set of decentralisation indicators over the last decade. this chapter first presents the indicator on sub-central tax revenue autonomy, followed by the indicators which reflect the restrictions attached to intergovernmental grants. the third section establishes the criteria that should help find the dividing line between tax sharing and intergovernmental grants, two fiscal arrangements that are often difficult to disentangle. for illustrative purposes, results are presented for the year 2005. finally, the results of a pilot study developing a set of spending power – or spending autonomy – indicators for a few oecd member countries are presented.chapter 2. on grant policy and the oecd-taxonomy of grantsthe chapter addresses two issues. one is to explain why earmarking, so much criticised, still is so much used. the second is to examine whether international grant statistics compare the degrees of local autonomy in a correct way. the distinction between earmarked and non-earmarked grants is the basic feature of the oecd classification of grants. the drivers of earmarking are listed. among these are the desire of the centre to implement merit wants, and the demand for precise compensation for the costs of new local competences. next a number of problems in the oecd classification of grants is described. among these are the unclear treatment of tax sharing revenues, the negative correlation between earmarking and regulation, the need for a grey zone between earmarking and non-earmarking, and the – in some cases large – grants for agent functions. the chapter ends with a summary of issues for improvements of the oecd statistics.chapter 3. measurement of decentralisation: how should we categorise tax sharing?the empirical studies of the economic effects on fiscal decentralisation depend critically on the correct measurement of decentralisation. and yet the various decentralisation measures conventionally used by researchers do not reflect the complex nature of sub-central fiscal frameworks. in particular, the sub-central share of revenue suffers from the fact that revenue arrangements in many countries consist of tax sharing, with or without in-equalisation. to overcome this problem, the oecd (2009) has developed a set of criteria that identify two types of tax sharing: one with strict tax base proportionality and the other without it. however, this definition still needs further refinement since it does not capture the different degrees of fiscal equalisation embedded in tax sharing arrangements. this chapter suggests a refinement of the tax sharing definition that captures the degree of (inverse) proportionality between local tax base and revenue from tax sharing.chapter 4. the role of decentralisation indicators in empirical researchthis chapter examines the role of decentralisation indicators and their use for empirical research. the chapter reviews first the conventional approach for capturing the degree of fiscal decentralisation. second, in order to capture the effects of fiscal decentralisation in empirical research, the data and estimation issues are discussed. third, the construction of indicators to capture the degree of fiscal decentralisation should be informed by recent incentive theory. even if a transfer is a lump sum, incentive effects may still exist. the concept of the soft budget constraint is useful for understanding the incentive structure behind lump sum transfers. the design and the timing of transfers are important. if the transfer is designed and allocated ex post after local government has undertaken specific actions, the transfer should not be regarded as a lump sum transfer ex post. the theoretical models suggest that a taxonomy of transfers is complicated and indicators of fiscal decentralisation should be carefully designed.chapter 5. measuring the extent of fiscal decentralisation: an application to the united statesthe goal of this chapter is to develop a taxonomy of decentralisation measures and how they are related to each other. in addition to introducing a common language for the different strands of literature, this taxonomy is instrumental for studying the outcomes of decentralisation. using cross-state data from the united states, we show that aggregating distinct dimensions of fiscal decentralisation into a single indicator inevitably leads to a loss of information in the form of lower explanatory power. we conclude that the distinct aspects of decentralisation should enter regression analyses separately, in the most flexible functional form possible. in particular, we find that revenue autonomy is virtually orthogonal to the subnational share of revenues and expenditures, suggesting that it carries additional information. in this chapter we show also how the conventional measures of decentralisation can be modified to account for the differing dependence on external grants.chapter 6. measuring decentralisation of public sector activities: conceptual issues and the case of germanythis chapter examines conceptual problems related to standard revenue and expenditure measures to assess government decentralisation. while the refinement of the revenue metric as proposed by the oecd comes close to expressing the degree of sub-central tax autonomy, there are still problems to be resolved for assessing tax sharing. suitable expenditure-oriented decentralisation measures are more difficult to construct. not only can central mandates or conditions imposed on funding limit the degree of fiscal autonomy of sub-central governments; it is also relevant to evaluate to which extent such constraints are binding for sub-central governments. the problems related to fiscal decentralisation measures are then discussed by looking at the german federal arrangements, which have raised some controversies in the past. fiscal measures alone may fall short in defining the degree of decentralisation in a country. a more comprehensive approach is needed. the chapter concludes with an outline of a more differentiated composite decentralisation index.chapter 7. taxonomy of grants and local taxes: the norwegian casethe chapter discusses a taxonomy of grants and local taxes based on the norwegian institutional context. a main issue is whether the major local tax, the personal income tax, should be classified as a tax with local discretion or a tax sharing arrangement. although local governments can formally set tax rates below the upper limit, it would give a more correct picture of the norwegian system if the local income tax was classified as a tax sharing arrangement. the taxonomy of grants is less problematic, but some earmarked grants constitute a grey zone in the sense that they work as non-earmarked grants. in addition, the vat compensation scheme should be classified as a non-earmarked grant.chapter 8. measuring decentralisation: the challenge of the danish storythe oecd has done path breaking work in developing indicators of local autonomy. the work begun in the late 1990s on a taxonomy of local taxing power seems especially promising. in contrast to measures of local shares of total expenditure and revenue it focuses on the discretion enjoyed by local authorities. this is at the heart of the theoretical concepts of local autonomy, authority or decentralisation. it is therefore recommendable to continue the oecd work on establishing a cross-national dataset on local taxing power. but there is still work ahead before this particular indicator is completely satisfactory. the danish experience shows how difficult it is to make a correct coding of individual countries. it is not enough to focus on official rules in national tax codes. at least in denmark, these rules are nested in informal institutions and supplemented by other formal rules that make the formal tax codes grossly misleading.chapter 9. from transfers to tax ""co-occupation"": the italian reform of intergovernmental financethis chapter provides insights into the current reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations in italy. the most relevant change is the abolition of transfers as an ordinary means of sub-central government finance, except for equalisation. since the room for autonomous local taxes is quite narrow, transfers will be mainly replaced by different forms of “co-occupation” of central taxes. using the oecd taxonomy of tax autonomy, we show that the effective increase in “infra-marginal” tax autonomy of sub-central governments brought about by the reform will be quite modest. at the margin, however, where autonomy really matters, there could be enough room for effective discretion. the main problem is that both the central and the sub-central governments fear tax power decentralisation. the former because it feels that, at least in the transition period, the electorate might not properly distinguish the different fiscal responsibilities; the latter because they would prefer not to tax their electorate.•

940@Moving towards a single labour contract: pros, cons and mixed feelings@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4c0vvc4zxv-en@we then build a simple model where both temporary and permanent contracts are available to firms. we use it to describe the demand for temporary contracts and the potential consequences of removing them and reach the following conclusions. first, employment protection has a moderate negative impact on employment, which can be mitigated when temporary contracts are available. second, the elimination of temporary contracts decreases total employment (by 7 percentage points according to our calculations). offsetting this effect would require an ambitious reform of employment protection laws of permanent contracts (in this specific setup, amounting to a cut in layoff costs by two thirds). finally, the coexistence of temporary and permanent contracts may also have negative effects on social norms within the firm and workers' motivation and eliminating temporary contracts could therefore enhance productivity in this context.we conclude that while there are costs to dualism, these are not as obvious and well established as the ones triggered by employment protection itself. further, the single employment contract may partly be a qui pro quo (misunderstanding) instead, more clarity on the objectives of a labour reform is needed.
941@The declining competitiveness of French firms reflects a generalised supply-side problem@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4c0dldmgr2-en@this short paper analyses the decline of france’s trade balance over the past 15 years. while the loss in export market shares is comparable to that of the major oecd countries except germany, it is one of the largest among the countries of the euro area. the determinants of this outcome seem to be general (rather than concentrated in the industrial sector) and related to overall supply-side weaknesses.
942@Labour market performance by age groups: a focus on France@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4c0dnhc58x-en@this paper analyses the age structure of employment rates across oecd countries with a focus on france. the statistical contribution of each age group to total unemployment-rate differentials is also computed. an estimate of the sensitivity of age-specific unemployment rates to the economic cycle is provided for oecd countries. france is one of the oecd countries having the highest dispersion of employment rates across age groups. the “within” component of the 15-29 age group accounts for over half of france’s total unemployment rate differential with best-performing countries. youth unemployment rate is especially sensitive to cyclical fluctuations in spain, belgium and france.

946@Boosting productivity in Australia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4c0vt9xhf3-en@australia’s productivity growth has decelerated markedly around the turn of the century. part of the decline is probably temporary, but raising multifactor productivity is key to ensure that living standards continue to grow strongly, especially if the currently strong terms of trade weaken over time. recent efforts by the government are welcome. ensuring responsive, high quality, vocational and higher education systems is indispensable to long-term growth. raising the completion rate of vocational students, and enhancing the level of collaboration among the key innovation players are priorities. the productivityenhancing effects of infrastructure could be boosted by more effective and strategic planning, new sources of funding, and better use of existing capacity. efficient pricing for infrastructure services and rapid progress towards harmonisation of regulations across states would boost competition and productivity.
947@Labour market and social policies to foster more inclusive growth in Sweden@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4c0vtwpttj-en@sweden is a very egalitarian country but inequalities have risen and some groups are poorly integrated into the labour market. for growth to become more inclusive, the gap between the cost of labour and productivity for some groups needs to be reduced, transitions from education to work should be facilitated, incentives to take a job ought to be strengthened and the non-employed need to be protected against the risk of falling into unemployment or inactivity traps. this calls for lowering minimum wages relative to the average wage for groups at risk of becoming unemployed, improving vocational education and training, and extending the coverage of the unemployment insurance while strengthening obligations for the unemployed. to address labour market duality risks, the gap in job protection between temporary and permanent contracts needs to be reduced. women’s employment is high but the gender wage gap could be narrowed further by enhancing their employment opportunities.
948@Structural reforms more important than ever for a strong and balanced economic recovery@http://www.oecd.org/economy/structuralreformsmoreimportantthaneverforastrongandbalancedeconomicrecovery.htm@"15/02/13 – structural reforms offer governments a powerful tool to boost economic growth, create jobs and bring about a strong and balanced economic recovery, according to the oecd’s latest going for growth report.this year's report assesses and compares progress that countries have made on structural reforms since 2011 and takes a fresh look at reform priorities to revive growth sustainably and boost employment. it shows that the pace of reform has accelerated where it is most needed – in the european countries hardest hit by sovereign debt duress, including greece, ireland, italy, portugal and spain. the report draws attention to the more moderate pace of reform in other euro area countries, notably those with current account surpluses, like germany or the netherlands. the highest-income oecd countries, like norway, switzerland and the united states, and key emerging-market economies are also shown to have made more limited progress on key reforms.sructural reforms can boost long-term growth and welfare but also underpin confidence and take some of the pressure off monetary and fiscal policies to buttress the recovery,"" said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “the road to a strong recovery remains fraught with challenges but measures taken in europe and the united states have reduced the likelihood of a worst-case scenario."" mr. gurría said. “we have reached a point where bold and concerted action to get the right mix of macro and structural policies can make an upside scenario a real possibility.”mr. gurría presented the report in moscow with the russian federation’s finance minister anton siluanov, ahead of the 15-16 february meeting of g20 finance ministers. he said its key country-specific structural reform recommendations are applicable to oecd and g20 countries alike.since going for growth was launched in 2005, the annual report has identified key reform priorities to boost economic activity and raise living standards in each oecd country. since 2011, the report also addresses reform potential in brazil, india, indonesia, china, the russian federation and south africa - the so-called brics - and is the basis of the oecd’s wider contribution to the g20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.“the good news is that many countries have stepped up their efforts in recent years” mr. gurría said. “active reforms in surplus and deficit countries alike would help achieve a quicker rebalancing of the global world economy, both globally and in the euro area.”dealing with the job market legacy of the crisis is a common challenge facing oecd and g20 countries, according to the report. compared with previous editions, going for growth 2013 contains a marked increase in recommendations aimed at helping cash-strapped governments devise methods to maintain social benefits for the unemployed while improving labour market policies that will help get people back to work:• in europe, where unemployment is still above pre-crisis levels, many countries (including denmark, france, italy, portugal, slovenia, spain and sweden) still need to lower barriers to job creation, hiring and mobility, while improving incentives to take up work.• in japan and korea, raising the labour force participation of women is key, and will require better benefits systems and improved childcare policies.• in lower-income oecd countries (like chile, mexico and turkey) and the brics, reducing informality is a common challenge, so governments must improve incentives to create and take jobs in the formal sector.• in the united states, unemployment has receded somewhat from its post-recession peak but the number of long-term unemployed and discouraged job seekers remain high, calling for programmes that provide training and employment services to be beefed up and streamlined. one special feature of this year’s report is to explore the side effects of pro-growth policies on other objectives, such as reducing income inequalities and preserving the environment. fostering greater equity in access to education - a priority for quite a number of countries, in advanced and emerging economies of the g20 alike - is a good case in point. but the report also finds that shifting part of the tax burden from labour to consumption is good for growth but likely to widen income inequalities. these policy trade-offs need to be borne in mind when designing growth policy packages.further information on going for growth 2013 is available at: www.oecd.org/economy/going-for-growth-2013.htm.detailed individual country notes are available on all oecd and briics countries.for further information, journalists should contact lawrence speer (+33 6 8014 0546, lawrence.speer@oecd,org) or the oecd media division (+33 1 4524 9700, news.contact@oecd.org)."
949@The G-20 Agenda under the Russian Chairmanship@http://www.oecd.org/economy/theg-20agendaundertherussianchairmanship.htm@institute of international finance conference: the g-20 agenda under the russian chairmanshipmuch more than growth!it’s an honour for me to address you today and share some thoughts on one of the most compelling policy questions of our time: how can we change the pace and pattern of growth to make it stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive?we are confronted today with a dilemma: as we all look for stronger growth, we also recognise that growth alone does not necessarily translate into greater well-being for our citizens. in other words, we need not only stronger growth, but also ”better” growth.the three key questions that i would like to address this evening demand innovative answers:• where is growth going to come from?• how sustainable will it be?• who is going to benefit from it?let me share with you our views on these crucial questions.where is growth going to come from over the next decades?emerging-market economies and developing countries have become the world’s main engine of growth. we have documented this already in 2010, when we coined the term “shifting wealth”, to describe the shift in the centre of gravity of the world economy from north to south and from west to east.the oecd development centre estimated that in the 1990s only 12 developing countries were growing at least twice as fast as the oecd average in gdp per capita terms. but the number of such “rapidly converging countries” rose to 83 in the last decade. this is an impressive change!we have also looked at major trends for the global economy over the next 50 years. our findings show that that the gaps in living standards between the world’s rich and poor countries will continue to shrink between now and 2060. in particular, china and india will experience more than a seven-fold increase of their income per capita and their combined gdp (in ppp terms) will exceed that of the current oecd membership by that time.still, despite strong growth, the levels of gdp per capita will continue to vary a great deal across countries. in 2010, 109 countries still had a gdp per capita lower than 25% of that of the united states. even maintaining strong growth, only 60 developing countries will be able to double their income per capita in the next 20 years.what our analysis shows is that many emerging-market and developing countries are unable to undergo the necessary structural transformations to sustain high-productivity growth. in other words, they are confronted with the perils of the “middle-income trap”: most middle-income countries face the growing competition from low-wage countries in global markets, but their firms are not competitive enough to break into those higher value-added segments of global value chains.this is a wake-up call for all of us: structural reforms are crucial for growth not only in the advanced economies that are now mired by the crisis, but also for emerging-market economies and developing countries.burdensome regulation and heavy-handed state intervention, insufficient competition in domestic markets, deficient education systems, widespread informality in the labour market, these are all bottlenecks that discourage innovation, prevent productivity from rising faster and constrain growth.structural reforms are a formidable tool: they are about putting in place the policies that can remove those obstacles and unleash opportunities for growth and development. the pay-offs from structural reforms - carried out in advanced and emerging economies alike - are huge. according to our recent simulations, a comprehensive, internally consistent package of reforms could deliver an increase in world gdp by 2.5% at the beginning of the next decade compared to a baseline scenario of limited reforms.[i]let me now address the second question:how sustainable will it be?we cannot continue to grow by creating havoc in our environment. stronger growth is indeed necessary, but we must stop our collision course with nature. the oecd environmental outlook to 2050, documents the economic, social and environmental consequences of maintaining a growth model that does not preserve our natural assets. the outlook is pretty scary!without resolute action, we show that world energy demand will be 80% higher in 2050, with most of this increase coming from the emerging-market economies. growth will still be mostly - 85% - reliant on fossil fuel-based energy, which could lead to a 50% increase in greenhouse gas emissions globally and cause the global average temperature to rise by 3 to 6°c by the end of the century. the developing countries, where natural assets represent an average 26% of national wealth, as opposed to 2% in advanced economies, have most to lose from a continued degradation of the environment.[ii]making development more sustainable is good for the economy. there is no trade-off here! in the oecd green growth strategy we identify policies that can make growth not only less carbon-intensive and more sustainable, but also help countries unleash the potential of green technologies and innovation as a new driver of prosperity.this is also true for the developing countries: for instance, ethiopia is developing an extremely ambitious green growth strategy and has requested the support of the oecd in this endeavour.and now my third and last question:who is going to benefit from this growth?the type of growth that we have been promoting has been unfair. it has benefited a happy few. we now have to make sure that the benefits of growth are shared equitably.strong growth has led to a sustained reduction of extreme poverty in the developing world. still, even where extreme poverty has been reduced, large sectors of the populations remain vulnerable, in particular those working in the informal sector, who may be too wealthy to benefit from targeted programmes but too poor to afford formal protection systems. this “missing-middle” problem affects today a growing number of emerging-market economies.while we focused on growth, inequality kept rising, both in the developed and developing countries. our publication divide we stand shows that the gap between rich and poor has widened in most oecd countries over the past 30 years.[iii]inequality is also rising in china and india. in other emerging economies, like brazil, chile and mexico, inequalities have started falling, and this is good news, but at a very slow pace and disparities in these countries are still huge.it is so important to make growth not only stronger but also more inclusive. it is not only about fairness, it is also about economics! with the same policy tools, we can promote inclusiveness and at the same time enhance growth. for example, investment in education and skills improves people’s earnings capacity and boosts productivity for the economy as a whole; deregulation to open protected sectors encourages investment that creates jobs and facilitates innovation.these are three questions that will define our future, the quality of life of our children and grand children, the health of our only planet. to address these challenges successfully we will need two indispensable tools: 1. new approaches to economic challenges; and 2. more inclusive multilateral cooperation.let me conclude with a few words on these two key elements:first, we need to renovate our economic knowledge and thinking. our traditional economic models have not only failed to avoid the worst financial crisis of our lifetime, in some cases they have produced it and fuelled it. this has cost millions of people their homes, their jobs, and their financial security for life. at oecd we believe that this crisis is a unique opportunity to rethink our models and concepts.we cannot simply repackage tools and recipes of the past. we need to look for new drivers of growth and understand better the synergies and trade-offs that exist between different policies to promote growth, to preserve the environment, to make our societies fairer. the economics profession bears considerable responsibility for this crisis and if it is to be useful again “it must go through an intellectual revolution”, as anatole kaletsky put it recently.this is why at the oecd we have launched our new approaches to economic challenges (naec) initiative, through which we are trying to revise, update and improve our economic thinking and to connect the new ideas to policy-making. we already had two big naec meetings and this is proving to be a most necessary and healthy exercise. thanks to this exercise the oecd economic advice is becoming broader, more modest, and more inclusive.we also need to improve our understanding of the complex realities and specific circumstances of developing countries. this is what we are aiming to achieve with our strategy on development: to integrate the diverse perspectives and realities of developing countries into oecd analysis and policy advice, and combine more effectively our expertise in different areas to provide a more coherent approach to development.second, we need to foster more inclusive multilateral cooperation. the only way we can address the various challenges that we are facing is through effective and inclusive multilateral cooperation. this is why the g20 is so important. in addition to addressing the immediate and most pressing challenges posed by the crisis, it serves as a forum for policymakers to pursue the shared objective of strong, balanced and sustained growth.we have already made significant progress in enriching the g20 agenda and focusing on the long-term challenges facing the global economy. the korean presidency put development high on the agenda of the g20; the french achieved an ambitious action plan on agriculture, food security and food price volatility. and the g20 has made progress in the realm of green growth under the leadership of the mexican presidency.but there is still a long way to go. i hear sometimes that there is a fatigue with the multilateral system and that the g20 is running out of steam. let me be clear: we do not share that view. the g20 has ample policy space for action and unrivalled political and economic firepower. yet, certainly, it still has to find the way to make the most of its leadership to tackle deep structural issues for the world economy.the crisis has given us a great opportunity to create a better world. we cannot waste it! as we build together the foundations of a better global economy let’s keep these three questions in mind: where is growth going to come from? how sustainable will it be? and who is going to benefit from this growth? growth is not a goal in itself, it is a medium to improve the quality of our lives, both in material and spiritual excellence.let’s not forget the words of the great dostoevsky: “man [..] like a chess-player, is interested in the process of attaining his goal rather than the goal itself.”[iv] let’s prove dostoevsky right and show that we, collectively, including within the g20, are not just interested in growth as a goal, but also in growth as a process with critical social and environmental ramifications for the future of our world.thank you very much.
950@UK: Boosting growth and tackling inequality are key to recovery@http://www.oecd.org/economy/uk-boosting-growth-and-tackling-inequality-are-keys-to-recovery.htm@6/02/2012 - britain must continue to pursue pro-growth, as well as inequality reducing structural reforms in order to recover from the nation's deepest recession in nearly a century, according to the oecd's latest economic survey of the ukthe effects of the global financial crisis, turbulence from the euro area, and weak domestic demand risk prolonging the downturn. this could reduce the country’s long-term growth potential and add to social pressures.presenting the survey in london, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said, however, that he is confident the uk economy has the capacity to recover over time, providing the right growth- enhancing policies are pursued.the report argues that monetary policy is a key tool to stimulate the economy in the short term, while the government’s fiscal plan, hard won credibility on the financial markets, and strong institutions allow it the flexibility to adapt to weaker than expected growth. it is appropriate to allow the deficit to shrink more slowly than initially planned to cushion the shock and help households through any downturn. additional tax increases or spending cuts - beyond those already planned - should not be imposed to compensate for a temporary slowdown, the survey says.but medium-term fiscal consolidation continues to be essential, it adds. the government’s plan has achieved a significant reduction of the public deficit, despite difficult economic conditions, but it is still over 8% of gdp (excluding one-offs), while the government debt–to-gdp ratio is above 80%.the survey emphasises the importance of implementing the right package of structural reforms to ensure a sustained recovery. “fiscal consolidation needs to be embedded in a comprehensive package that also promotes growth. further structural reforms are key to a stronger, more inclusive and prosperous britain”, said mr gurria.the survey outlines what needs to be done to combat inequality by raising the number and quality of jobs, investing in people’s skills and strengthening the welfare system. among the recommendations are measures to tackle skill shortages, ease the transition from education to the job market and increase incentives to move off benefits and into work.• on youth training and apprenticeship programmes, better cooperation is needed between government agencies and employers, particularly small businesses. improved cooperation is also required between businesses, colleges and local authorities to integrate graduates more effectively into the labour market.• work incentives for single parents and potential second earners in families should be improved within the universal credit welfare reform, such as by increasing the refund rate for childcare.active labour market policies need to work hand-in-hand with growth-enhancing structural reforms. the uk’s falling productivity must be raised. excessively restrictive land-use planning regulations and insufficient investment in r&d and in productive infrastructure, such as transport and energy, are creating obstacles to growth.the survey says careful loosening of planning restrictions can boost construction, create jobs, make housing more affordable and encourage investment. other recommendations include:review certain tax rules that may be hampering business growth, such as preferential treatment for small firms which could act as a disincentive for highly productive firms to expand.• continue to improve the business environment and provide government support to boost exports.• support higher education as an export and avoid excessive restrictions on student visas.• promote green growth. road pricing should be introduced on the most congested motorways and then gradually extended to other roads with high traffic density. move towards a uniform price for carbon across sectors and fuels.mr gurría also welcomed the uk’s commitment to working with the oecd to avoid tax base erosion and profit shifting. the work involves reviewing and upgrading the rules and standards of international taxation. an oecd report will be presented to the g20 next week.to obtain a copies of the survey, or for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 9700); or visit; www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/uk2013.htm
951@Do policies that reduce unemployment raise its volatility? Evidence from OECD countries@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4c9kmlg08v-en@in this paper we examine whether past labour market reforms aiming at reducing the rate of unemployment have raised its long-run volatility. using non-linear panel data models applied to 24 oecd countries between 1985 and 2007, as well as monte-carlo techniques, we do not find any evidence of such policy trade-off. in contrast, we find that reduced unemployment benefit duration, more competition-inducing product market regulation and looser employment protection legislation are associated with a weaker persistence of unemployment over time, which implies a lower volatility of unemployment in the long run. more specifically, the evidence suggests that even in the case of reforms that may have raised the shortterm sensitivity of unemployment to business cycles (such as with the easing of employment protection), the weaker persistence effect dominates the higher cyclical volatility, implying a net reduction in long-term volatility.

957@Long-term growth scenarios@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/long-term-growth-scenarios_5k4ddxpr2fmr-en@this paper presents the results from a new model for projecting growth of oecd and major non-oecd economies over the next 50 years as well as imbalances that arise. a baseline scenario assuming gradual structural reform and fiscal consolidation to stabilise government-debt-to gdp ratios is compared with variant scenarios assuming deeper policy reforms. one main finding is that growth of the non-oecd g20 countries will continue to outpace oecd countries, but the difference will narrow substantially over coming decades. in parallel, the next 50 years will see major changes in the composition of the world economy. in the absence of ambitious policy changes, global imbalances will emerge which could undermine growth. however, ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts and deep structural reforms can both raise long-run living standards and reduce the risks of major disruptions to growth by mitigating global imbalances.

959@Strengthening Euro Area banks@http://www.oecd.org/economy/strengtheningeuroareabanks.htm@big changes are needed to strengthen the capital positions of euro area bankseuropean banks remain at the heart of the euro area crisis. despite actions to strengthen banks and build a banking union, confidence in the euro area banking system remains weak, and is likely to remain so until underlying concerns over low capitalisation of some banks are addressed.low bank capitalisation persists in many countries despite an eu requirement that banks reach in 2012 a ratio of a minimum 9% of the best quality “core tier-1” capital to risk-weighted assets, in excess of the current international requirements.why has this new benchmark not been sufficient to boost confidence? in part, this is because it is based on risk-weighting of assets that likely understates risks, due to reliance on banks’ own internal risk models and, for example, the zero risk-weight given to sovereign debt. the ratio of core tier-1 capital to unweighted assets of euro area banks currently falls well short of 5% in many cases. this standard has been identified as a benchmark for well-capitalised banks in a recent oecd paper and it is more demanding than the minimum basel iii leverage ratio that will apply from 2018.increasing the capacity of european banks to absorb losses, by increasing their capital relative to assets needs to be addressed in the coming years. if the euro area’s largest banks were to move to a 5% standard, the current capital shortage is estimated at around eur 400bn (4¼ per cent of euro area gdp). this is not just a problem for banks in the “periphery” – there could be large capital needs in the major euro area countries. future capital needs could be lessened if banks were required to separate commercial banking and market activities, reducing the total assets of the banking business.moving towards a stronger banking system would help to rebuild confidence and get credit flowing again.the estimates are based on company reports and oecd calculations for around 200 euro area banks using a bottom-up approach that, first, assesses the additional capital required for each individual bank to reach a 5% leverage ratio and then adds up capital needs for currently under-capitalised banks based on this yardstick to obtain national and area-wide estimates of additional capital needs. the estimates are based on consolidated bank balance sheets, which are prepared on an ifrs basis and refer to information available as of september 2012. the estimated increase in bank capital to reach the 5% leverage ratio in greece is likely to decline substantially following the end-november decision of the eurogroup to disburse the efsf loan which includes 23.8 billion euros earmarked for bank recapitalisation. the estimates do not incorporate additional capital to cover potential future losses nor do they incorporate increases due to changes in the definition of core tier-1 capital under basel iii to be implemented by 2018.it should be underlined that a 5% leverage ratio does not currently form part of the internationally agreed basel iii framework, which expresses capital requirements in terms of risk-weighted assets and tier-1 rather than core tier-1 capital. a 3% leverage ratio based on total assets has been proposed in that framework as a backstop from 2018.

961@Euro area labour costs converging, but imbalances persist@http://www.oecd.org/economy/euroarealabourcosts.htm@the euro area crisis finds its roots in the credit booms seen in many countries following the introduction of the euro in 1999. easy credit led to strong growth in a range of sectors, notably housing, as well as higher levels of public spending. inflation in these over-heating economies was higher than the euro area as a whole. rising prices led to rising costs and a loss of international competiveness.this graph illustrates how the cost of each unit of output produced (unit labour costs) rose much faster than average over the past decade in credit boom countries like greece and spain. in france and italy, unit labour costs rose when wages grew faster than productivity. the story was different in germany, where weak domestic demand and wage restraint meant that costs remained more or less flat.since the crisis, costs have begun to come down in many countries, as demand has fallen and unemployment has risen. economies that run external deficits are beginning to rebalance, by slowing down wage growth, lowering export prices and boosting foreign demand. at the same time, wages in germany are rising faster than elsewhere, as they catch up to the stronger performance of the economy in recent years.this necessary adjustment is underway, but not yet complete. the oecd predicts that costs will continue adjusting over the coming two years, bringing relative costs among euro area countries in line with their 2000 levels. this would be an encouraging sign that the euro area is moving out of the crisis.unfortunately, most of the adjustment so far has stemmed from weak domestic demand and high unemployment. most euro area countries still need to implement further structural reforms to make their economies more efficient while restraining wage growth. germany should implement policies that lead to further adjustment of relative costs and demand.

964@Strengthening innovation in the United States@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k8zl62hxmf6-en@the us innovation system has many strengths, including world class research universities and firms that thrive in innovation-intensive sectors. however, fissures have begun to appear, notably in the areas of human capital development, the patent system and manufacturing activity, while public investments in r&d and research universities are at risk of being curtailed by budget cuts. revitalizing the dynamism of innovation has become a priority for us policymakers. to this end, it is important that federal and state governments sustain financial support for knowledge creation. the us workforce’s skills will need to be upgraded, especially in stem fields, and measures taken to provide more favourable framework conditions for developing advanced manufacturing in the united states. while the recent patent reform is a big step in the right direction, patent reform needs to be taken further by ensuring that the legal standards for granting injunctive relief and damages awards for patent infringement reflect realistic business practices and the relative contributions of patented components of complex technologies.
965@Global economy facing hesitant and uneven recovery, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/globaleconomyfacinghesitantandunevenrecoverysaysoecd.htm@"27/11/2012 - the global economy is expected to make a hesitant and uneven recovery over the coming two years. decisive policy action is needed to ensure that stalemate over fiscal policy in the united states and continuing euroarea instability do not plunge the world back into recession, according to the oecd’s latest global economic outlook, june 2017.“the world economy is far from being out of the woods,” oecd secretary-general angel gurría said during the economic outlook launch in paris. “the us ‘fiscal cliff’, if it materialises, could tip an already weak economy into recession, while failure to solve the euro area crisis could lead to a major financial shock and global downturn. governments must act decisively, using all the tools at their disposal to turn confidence around and boost growth and jobs, in the united states, in europe, and elsewhere,” mr gurría said (read the full speech).gdp growth across the oecd is projected to match this year’s 1.4% in 2013, before gathering momentum to 2.3% for 2014, according to the outlook.in the united states, provided the “fiscal cliff” is avoided, gdp growth is projected at 2% in 2013 before rising to 2.8% in 2014. in japan, gdp is expected to expand by 0.7% in 2013 and 0.8% in 2014. the euro area will remain in recession until early 2013, leading to a mild contraction in gdp of 0.1% next year, before growth picks up to 1.3% in 2014.after softer-than-expected activity during 2012, growth has begun picking up in the emerging-market economies, with increasingly supportive monetary and fiscal policies offsetting the drag exerted by weak external demand. china is expected to grow at 8.5% in 2013 and 8.9% in 2014, while gdp is also expected to gather steam in the coming years in brazil, india, indonesia, russia and south africa.labour markets remain weak, with around 50 million jobless people in the oecd area, the outlook said. unemployment is set to remain high, or even rise further, in many countries unless structural measures are used to boost near-term employment growth.the euro area crisis remains a serious threat to the world economy, despite recent measures that have dampened near-term pressures. adjustment of deep-rooted imbalances across the euro area has begun, but much more is needed to ensure long-term sustainability, including structural reform in both deficit and surplus countries.more needs to be done to tackle negative links in the euro area between public finances, bank solvency and risks that any country may have to leave the euro. in the long run, this requires a fully-fledged banking union with fiscal backstops. recapitalisation of banks should be undertaken where necessary.the outlook suggests a possible positive scenario could arise if decisive policy actions are taken to improve business and consumer confidence, and to boost growth and jobs worldwide. the rapid and broad implementation of structural reforms, not least in labour and product markets, is key to this scenario.>> for further information, journalists should contact the oecd media office (news.contact@oecd.org; +33 1 45 24 97 00).>> economic outlook no. 92 is available as a free preview on ilibrary"
966@Selected aspects of household savings in Germany – evidence from micro-data@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/selected-aspects-of-household-savings-in-germany_5k8zpt6w2k7h-en@this paper uses household level data from the german socio-economic panel (gsoep) over the period 1991 to 2008 to analyse the driving factors of movements in the german household savings rate. specifically, it analyses the impact of the precautionary savings motive and the impact of the 2002 private pension reform (the so-called riester reform) on households’ savings rate as these factors are among the most discussed in the german context. there is evidence for both factors at work: first, households with a more volatile income stream tend to save more and the extent to which they do depends on their (subjectively assessed) risk aversion. second, the introduction of the riester pension scheme in 2002 was associated with a general increase in the household savings rate, both for households that signed up for private pension contracts and for those that did not. this effect is not found for low-income households, thus confirming the findings of other studies.

968@Lanzamiento del Informe Perspectivas Económicas de América Latina 2013: Transformación de la Estructura Productiva y Papel de las PYMES en el Desarrollo Regional@http://www.oecd.org/economy/lanzamientodelinformeperspectivaseconomicasdeamericalatina2013transformaciondelaestructuraproductivaypapeldelaspymeseneldesarrolloregional.htm@palabras de angel gurría, secretario general ocdecádiz, españa. 16 de noviembre de 2012(as prepared for delivery)excelentísimo ministro, queridos alicia y enrique, cancilleres, señoras y señores:es un placer lanzar por sexta vez consecutiva nuestro informe perspectivas económicas de américa latina en el marco de la cumbre iberoamericana. quiero empezar agradeciendo al gobierno español el apoyo continuado a este importante trabajo que pretende tender puentes entre américa latina y la ocde a partir del intercambio de experiencias y mejores prácticas.también quiero agradecerle a enrique iglesias el espacio que se nos abre siempre en las cumbres para presentar este trabajo, que precisamente aspira a alimentar con datos y análisis el debate sobre los temas que la secretaría pro-témpore y la segib identifican como ejes centrales de la cumbre.y por supuesto, mi más sincero reconocimiento va para la cepal, aquí representada por alicia, por esa enriquecedora y fructífera colaboración que hace posible la elaboración de este informe, año tras año.alicia y yo hemos convenido presentar las principales conclusiones y recomendaciones de manera orquestada, así que yo me centraré más en el análisis de la situación macroeconómica y los retos que enfrentan las economías de la región, en especial en materia de productividad. alicia abordará en más detalle el papel de las pymes y las políticas que pueden impulsar su desarrollo.situación macroeconómica: resistencia a la crisis, pero importantes desafíosen conjunto, américa latina sigue resistiendo bien los embates de la crisis global.esperamos que la región crezca un 3.2% en 2012 y un 4.0% en 2013. aunque se registran algunos signos de moderación en el ritmo de crecimiento, la demanda interna, el consumo privado y el dinamismo del mercado laboral permiten sostener las buenas perspectivas. así, la tasa de desempleo alcanzará en 2012, con 6.5%, su mínimo histórico. en el futuro inmediato, este dinamismo permitirá a la región continuar disminuyendo la pobreza y desigualdad.a su vez, en caso de una caída en la demanda agregada, los indicadores macroeconómicos ofrecen espacio de maniobra fiscal en muchos países, con una deuda pública en el promedio de la región en torno al 39% del pib, menos de la mitad del promedio de la ocde. muchos bancos centrales gozan de la credibilidad y el margen de maniobra necesarios para actuar de manera contra-cíclica, sobre todo en la medida que el aumento transitorio en los índices de precios por el incremento de los precios de alimentos se vaya moderando en los próximos meses, como lo esperamos.a pesar de este desempeño favorable en el corto plazo, la región afronta importantes desafíos para su desarrollo a largo plazo. la menor demanda externa pondrá al descubierto las limitaciones del actual patrón de crecimiento basado en la escasa incorporación de valor agregado y la excesiva dependencia en la exportación de recursos naturales.al mismo tiempo, y pese al margen de maniobra fiscal, la recaudación tributaria sigue siendo excesivamente baja para brindar servicios públicos de calidad que faciliten el desarrollo social. la segunda edición de las estadísticas tributarias en américa latina que acabamos de publicar con la cepal y el centro interamericano de administraciones tributarias muestra que pese a que la recaudación promedio de la región aumentó desde el 14.0% del pib en 1990 al 19.4% en 2010, todavía dista mucho del 33.8% de la ocde. además de aumentar la base tributaria, es necesario diversificar su estructura, haciendo al sistema más progresivo y equitativo. la reforma fiscal sigue siendo una importante asignatura pendiente.no puede haber lugar, por lo tanto, para la complacencia. el crecimiento potencial del pib en américa latina es todavía bajo para acelerar la reducción de la pobreza, disminuir las desigualdades y cerrar la brecha en los niveles de bienestar material con respecto a los países desarrollados.la necesidad de diversificar la estructura productiva y elevar la productividadla estructura productiva de la región presenta importantes desafíos: la productividad es baja y el modelo económico sigue demasiado concentrado en las materias primas.es necesario ahondar en la diversificación y apostar por sectores exportadores que generen valor agregado y creen empleo. en este sentido, la prioridad radica en impulsar políticas que incidan sobre aquellos factores que inhiben la productividad de las empresas en américa latina. estos factores incluyen los déficits que la región padece en materia de competencias y capital humano, infraestructura e i+d.por ejemplo, en materia de formación de recursos humanos, nuestro último informe pisa muestra que casi un 50% de los estudiantes latinoamericanos no alcanzan el nivel mínimo aceptable en los exámenes de comprensión lectora, frente al 20% en la ocde. lo mismo ocurre con las infraestructuras: américa latina invierte alrededor de un 2% de su pib en infraestructuras, pero debería invertir un 5%—es decir, más del doble—de aquí a 2020 para satisfacer la demanda. la inversión en innovación es otro ejemplo ilustrativo: américa latina solo invierte alrededor del 0.6% de su pib in i+d, mientras que los países de la ocde invierten cuatro veces más.otro aspecto importante lo constituye la integración comercial, en especial para países cuyo mercado doméstico es reducido. en este sentido, es necesario seguir profundizando en la eliminación de barreras comerciales y trabas administrativas. una mayor integración comercial no sólo facilita el acceso a nuevos mercados, sino que también permite activar nuevas dinámicas y oportunidades a través de la complementariedad y el aprendizaje mutuo. las pymes: un agente clave para el incremento de la competitividad y la redistribuciónen este entorno productivo, como destaca el informe que presentamos hoy, las pymes representan una oportunidad en cualquier estrategia que aspire a elevar la competitividad y facilitar un desarrollo incluyente.el 99% del total de empresas latinoamericanas son pymes, y generan dos de cada tres empleos en la región. sin embargo, su contribución al pib y a las exportaciones es mucho más limitada, fruto de niveles de productividad muy por debajo de las empresas de mayor tamaño. de hecho, los niveles de productividad de las grandes empresas en américa latina son hasta 6 veces mayores que las de las empresas pequeñas. en la ocde, por el contrario, estas diferencias se reducen hasta 2.4 veces.para eliminar estas brechas se necesitan políticas públicas que terminen con las numerosas barreras externas e internas a las que se enfrentan las pymes en materia de financiamiento, retención de capital humano calificado y acceso a la innovación y a los mercados internacionales . por ejemplo, mientras que aproximadamente un 25% del total de crédito tiene como beneficiarias a las pymes en los países de la ocde, el porcentaje es de sólo el 12% en américa latina.más allá de políticas de corte horizontal, es importante considerar las características específicas de las empresas y su entorno. la alta heterogeneidad de las pymes requiere de políticas que tenga en cuenta las especificidades derivadas de las cadenas de valor en la que participan, su mercado de destino, y su ubicación geográfica.el desajuste que existe entre la presencia de las pymes en la economía y su contribución a la misma debe ser considerado seriamente. eliminarlo no sólo facilitará alcanzar niveles de productividad más altos para el conjunto de la economía, sino también mejorar la distribución del ingreso al generar más y mejores empleos en estas empresas.conclusiónantes de pasarle la palabra a alicia, que entrará en más detalle sobre las políticas concretas que recomendamos para facilitar un desarrollo productivo de las pymes, me gustaría reiterar el mensaje clave de este informe: américa latina necesita un enfoque integral de políticas públicas, centrado en la facilitación de un desarrollo productivo incluyente y basado en el conocimiento.los logros de la región en la última década no son un espejismo, como tampoco lo es la capacidad con la que se está sorteando la crisis global. pero los desafíos estructurales siguen presentes, y el terreno avanzado se puede perder rápidamente si las economías latinoamericanas no diversifican su estructura productiva hacia sectores que favorezcan incrementos de productividad y exportaciones más competitivas. las pymes deben ser un elemento fundamental de esta estrategia.muchas gracias y adelante, alicia.
969@New SME policies needed to boost Latin America's growth, say OECD and ECLAC@http://www.oecd.org/economy/newsmepoliciesneededtoboostlatinamericasgrowthsayoecdandeclac.htm@16/11/2012 – after nearly a decade of continuous expansion, gdp growth in latin america will slow from 4.4% in 2011 to 3.2% in 2012 and 4.0% in 2013. the outlook remains relatively positive, but is exposed to global uncertainty and volatility. latin american governments must act now to strengthen growth and development and counter these risks, according to the 2013 latin american economic outlook, jointly produced by the oecd development centre and eclac.“now is the time for latin america to go structural, to build on previous reforms and make further progress to reduce inequality and strengthen economic growth. the global context calls for structural change to enhance productivity, to enhance productivity in the region.” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría, launching the report at the xxii iberoamerican summit in spain. “smes in latin america have the potential to act as catalysts and help the region drive up productivity. greater coordination is needed to help smes overcome obstacles in terms of access to financing, human capital and innovation.”small and medium enterprises (smes) must play a central role in unleashing latin america's growth potential and creating higher quality jobs. they represent an overwhelming majority of private enterprises in the region: smes account for 99% of businesses and employ 67% of employees. however, their contributions to gdp and overall productivity are low: whereas large firms in latin america have productivity levels 6 times higher than those of smes, this difference is only 2.4 times in oecd countries. a common problem for smes is not so much their size, but their isolation in the productive structure, which makes them unable to scale up production and specialise.“social progress is not limited to social policies. the structural heterogeneity and persistent productivity gaps, between and within sectors and enterprises, form a hard core from which inequality spreads throughout society, exacerbating capability and opportunity gaps”, underlined alicia bárcena ibarra, executive secretary of eclac. “public policies and governments, in particular, have an important role to play in defining and conducting new holistic approaches for development where industrial policy and smes are considered to be at the center of the development agenda”.new policies in the areas of finance, innovation and information and communication technologies (ict) are needed, as well as increasing training for employees and reducing skills mismatches.access to finance is one of the main obstacles faced by smes: only 12% of total credit in the region goes to these firms, compared to 25% in oecd countries. meanwhile, 34% of small businesses in latin america believe access to finance is a serious constraint. smes are often charged much higher interest rates than large firms by commercial banks, up to double the rate in several countries.the growing provision of financial services by development banks is making headway in the sector, such as innovar by the studies and projects funding agency (finep) in brazil, the entrepreneurs programme by nacional financiera (nafin) in mexico and the business angels network by the production development corporation (corfo) in chile. more such programmes need to be developed and scaled up.more intensive use of icts will also help smes become more competitive, enter the international markets at a lower cost and improve their management. beyond mobile and fixed telephony, there are still significant gaps between smes and large firms in the use of more advanced technologies, such as having a website, an intranet or access to broadband.limited access to qualified labour is another major problem facing smes. indeed, 37% of companies in the region believe finding workers with the necessary training is one of their main obstacles, a figure higher than both the global average and the average for other developing regions. latin american countries would benefit from establishing or strengthening the institutional structure and the incentives for smes to provide training for their staff.for further information, please contact:published for the sixth consecutive year, the latin american economic outlook 2013 features a macro-economic analysis of trends in the region and a focus on smes policies for structural change. the content of the report will

971@Balance of economic power will shift dramatically over the next 50 years, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/balanceofeconomicpowerwillshiftdramaticallyoverthenext50yearssaysoecd.htm@"09/11/2012 - the balance of economic power is expected to shift dramatically over the next half century, with fast-growing emerging-market economies accounting for an ever-increasing share of global output, according to a new oecd report.divergent long-term growth patterns lead to radical shifts in the relative size of economies. the united states is expected to cede its place as the world's largest economy to china, as early as 2016. india’s gdp is also expected to pass that of the united states over the long term. combined, the two asian giants will soon surpass the collective economy of the g7 nations. fast-ageing economic heavyweights, such as japan and the euro area, will gradually lose ground on the global gdp table to countries with a younger population, like indonesia and brazil (see chart).looking to 2060: a global vision of long-term growth uses a new model for projecting growth in the 34 oecd members and 8 major non-oecd g20 economies over the next 50 years. the report forecasts global economic growth of 3 percent annually, with sharp differences between the emerging-market economies, which are expected to grow at a much faster pace, and the advanced countries, which will likely grow at slower and often declining rates. cross-country gdp per capita differences mainly reflect differences in technology levels, capital intensity, human capital and skills.""the economic crisis we have been living with for the past five years will eventually be overcome, but the world our children and grandchildren inherit may be starkly different from ours,"" said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. ""as the largest and fastest-growing emerging countries fully assume a more prominent place in the global economy, we will face new challenges to ensure a prosperous and sustainable world for all. education and productivity will be the main drivers of future growth, and should be policy priorities worldwide.the shifting balance of long-term global output will lead to corresponding improvements in living standards, with income per capita expected to more than quadruple in the poorest countries by 2060. the increase could even be seven-fold in china and india. with these gains, the gap that currently exists in living standards between emerging-markets and advanced economies will have narrowed by 2060. but large cross-country differences will persist. china will see more than a seven-fold increase in per capita income over the coming half century, but living standards will still only be 60% of that in the leading countries in 2060. india will experience similar growth, but its per capita income will only be about 25% of that in advanced countries. ""none of these forecasts are set in stone,"" mr. gurría said. ""we know that bold structural reforms can boost long-term growth and living standards in advanced and emerging-market economies alike.""oecd research shows that wide-ranging labour and product market reforms could raise long-term living standards by an average of 16% over the next 50 years relative to the baseline scenario, which only assumes moderate policy improvements.>> for further information, journalists should contact the oecd media office (news.contact@oecd.org; +33 1 45 24 97 00).>> policy challenges for the next 50 years (download the pdf version)"
972@Improving the tax system in Indonesia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k92smvqbb8v-en@effective macroeconomic and structural policies helped turkey bounce back quickly and strongly from the global crisis, with annual growth averaging close to 9% over 2010-11. however, the current account deficit widened to around 10% of gdp in 2011 and consumer price inflation rose to over 10%. the external deficit, which is far too large for comfort, is a source of vulnerability. so is high inflation, even if it partly reflects transient factors. these imbalances signal competitiveness problems and a dearth of domestic saving. they need to be addressed using both macroeconomic and structural policy levers. monetary policy has recently tried to reduce the volatility of capital flows but inflation has been high and volatile. the inflation target needs to be given greater prominence. the fiscal stance remains broadly appropriate but could be tighter, if warranted, to complement monetary restraint and help keep the real exchange rate on a sustainable path. more balanced growth through strengthened competitiveness and greater private saving calls inter alia for increased labour force participation, accelerated formalisation, stronger productivity growth, improvements in financial literacy and a more attractive menu of saving instruments. improvements in the business environment would spur foreign direct investment, making for healthier funding of the external gap. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of turkey (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/turkey).
973@Unleashing business innovation in Canada@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/unleashing-business-innovation-in-canada_5k912j63dn25-en@this paper discusses how to improve canada’s business innovation in order to boost labour productivity and output growth. many general framework conditions are highly favourable to business risk-taking and innovation, including macro stability, openness, strong human capital, low corporate tax rates, low barriers to firm entry and flexible labour markets. however, they can be improved further by reduced external and interprovincial barriers in network and professional service sectors, more efficient capital markets, fewer capital tax distortions and improved patent protection. a second focus should be on ensuring that incentives arising from government subsidies are targeted on actual market failures. the very high level of support to business r&d via the federal scientific research and experimental development (sr&ed) tax credit and provincial top-ups may affect the incentives of small firms to grow and should be redesigned. a plethora of small, fragmented granting programmes, mainly geared to smes, should be streamlined for better government-business collaboration. the large public share in venture capital should be wound down, as it may crowd out more productive private finance. a final focus should be on boosting manager and worker skills that are intrinsic to all forms of innovation, by filling gaps in training, mentoring and education. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic review of canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/canada).
974@Improving the tax system in Indonesia@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/improving-the-tax-system-in-indonesia_5k912j3r2qmr-en@indonesia has come a long way in improving its tax system over the last decade, both in terms of revenues raised and administrative efficiency. nonetheless, the tax take is still low, given the need for more spending on infrastructure and social protection. with the exception of the natural resources sector, increasing tax revenues would be best achieved through broadening tax bases and improving tax administration, rather than changes in the tax schedule that seems broadly in line with international practice. possible measures to broaden the tax base include bringing more of the self-employed into the tax system, subjecting employer-provided fringe benefits and allowances to personal income taxation and reducing the exemptions from value-added taxes. similarly, broad-based investment credits would be a less distortive way to enhance investment incentives than selective tax holidays. introducing a targeted, simplified tax regime for small and medium-sized enterprises, as currently planned by the government, could foster their integration into the tax system in the longer run, even if its short-run revenue potential is limited. upgrading tax administration has made substantial progress in indonesia since 2002, although there is still scope to improve the training of tax officers and the administration’s audit and litigation capacities, while strengthening internal control systems and enhancing the transparency of administrative decisions. the audit system could be further improved by allocating more tax audits on the basis of compliance risks. in the natural resources sector, particularly in mining, there is a case for increasing the government’s share of resource rents through higher tax rates imposed on these rents, as opposed to taxing revenues. this would imply a willingness of the government to bear a larger share of the exploration and development risk than heretofore, which indonesia, with its improved access to international financial markets and a diversified resource portfolio, is now well placed to do. in the mining sector, a powerful rent tax regime with a large government take would serve the country better than export taxes and ownership restrictions that have been decided recently. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic review of indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/indonesia).
975@Global Perspectives Conference:  Development Beyond 2015 – Sustainable, Equitable and Truly Global@http://www.oecd.org/economy/globalperspectivesconferencedevelopmentbeyond2015sustainableequitableandtrulyglobal.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, at the global perspectives conferenceberlin, 31 october 2012it is a great pleasure to be here today at the fourth annual global perspectives conference. i would like to thank the berlin civil society center, and especially burkhard gnärig, for kindly inviting me to deliver this keynote address.this year’s global perspectives conference will tackle a critical issue: development beyond 2015. in other words, how do we envision development in the post mdg era?development is often associated with eliminating poverty and raising gdp per capita, but it is a much broader issue. at the oecd we envision development as the quest for a better quality of life for all people to be achieved with a growth path that is both sustainable and inclusive. this means recognising that all countries need to progress in different spheres, including - as the crisis has shown - oecd members.as you know, we are now into the fifth year of the greatest financial, economic, and most importantly, social crisis since the oecd was created. we are still wrestling with its dire consequences. many countries are under immense pressure to put their public finances back on a sustainable footing. close to 14 million jobs are needed to bring employment back to its pre-crisis levels. social tensions and hopelessness are growing in many countries.this has resulted in a general loss of trust in markets, governments and institutions. citizens are questioning the ability of policymakers to rise to current challenges. and they are becoming more and more impatient.the response by governments cannot be “more of the same” or “business as usual” policies. we need to revisit models and theories to question conventional wisdoms and “established truths.” this means being open to drawing pertinent and sometimes difficult conclusions from the crisis. like, for example, that the monetary and fiscal policies we have followed in the recent decades have failed us, as bill white wrote in a recent paper he prepared for the oecd.we need to look for new solutions. this is the objective of our initiative on “new approaches to economic challenges”. this initiative is helping us examine what lessons can be learned from the crisis and what policy implications can be derived from these lessons. the main goal is to overhaul our analytical framework, while identifying a renewed strategic policy agenda for inclusive growth and well-being. we just had our first naec meeting last week and it was quite a shake up.at the oecd we are also revising our notion of “progress”, moving from a narrow focus on gdp to a more multi-dimensional approach. this is something we have been working on for many years, culminating under the better life initiative, launched in 2011. we’ve created the better life index, an online interactive tool that allows citizens to compare well-being across countries according to their individual priorities.a new vision of development also demands that we understand better the likely side-effects and spill-overs of different policy options, the sometimes unintended consequences of policy initiatives. it is crucial, for example, that we identify the mutually reinforcing aspects of growth and environmental policies, and that we work and cooperate internationally to enhance these synergies.promoting development needs to focus on reducing inequality. as we show in our study “divided we stand”, the gap in income between rich and poor in oecd countries is now the widest it has been in 30 years. the proverbial “rising tide” has not lifted all boats. we need to examine whether and which growth-enhancing policy reforms have positive or negative side-effects on income inequality.to turn this new vision of development into decisions and policies, at the oecd we have launched a comprehensive and ambitious development strategy, which aims to integrate the diverse perspectives and realities of developing countries in oecd analyses and policy advice, combine more effectively oecd’s expertise on a wide range of policy areas with our experience in development co-operation and provide a more coherent approach to development. in busan, we promoted the important paradigm shift from aid effectiveness to development effectiveness. we need to work on a development architecture in which aid will remain a crucial part, but in which we focus also more on promoting drivers for inclusive growth, innovation, domestic resource mobilisation, strong institutions and good governance.but all these efforts to promote a new type of development will not bear fruit if we don’t incorporate civil society.time for an “all on board” development effort: the role of civil societythis time civil society has to be part of the equation. big time! working with civil society can help to create a broader consensus which makes policies and reforms easier to accept and implement. this is the philosophy behind the oecd’s multi-stakeholder approach. this collaboration can also help governments to design policies that are well tuned to the real needs of the people. one important example are the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises which are far reaching recommendations for responsible business conduct that 44 adhering governments – representing all regions of the world and accounting for 85% of foreign direct investment – encourage their enterprises to observe wherever they operate. and in the 2011 update many of you participated.another strong example of oecd and civil society collaboration is our work on anti-bribery. the oecd’s anti-bribery convention provides a useful base for civil society work. as civil society organisations (csos) are consulted and involved in our country reviews, together we increase the pressure on governments to increase enforcement efforts. as a result, nearly 210 individuals and 90 entities have been sanctioned under criminal proceedings for foreign bribery, according to 2011 data.[1]we also engage with csos in other areas. at the 2010 global perspectives conference, for example, we worked with a range of civil society leaders to create more coherent, strategic, and useful engagement between the oecd and civil society. one conclusion was that we need to engage collectively with csos beyond previous sectoral and disjointed work. why?increasingly oecd work and solutions are multi-dimensional. our members ask us to focus on what we call “horizontal” projects, using a “whole-of-the-oecd” approach to address complex and interrelated issues. naec is clearly one example; others include our recent strategies on innovation, green growth, and development.these multi-dimensional issues require a different approach to civil society engagement than the more narrowly-defined consultation processes of oecd committees. in our previous discussions, you’ve advised us to organise civil society dialogues around our strategic cross-sectoral themes. since then we have held two of these dialogues in the form of interactive ideafactories, one of which provided us with initial food for thought on naec.this work can be extremely useful for today’s discussions on developing an mdgs successor framework. let me conclude by sharing the oecd’s perspective on this topic.the oecd played a pivotal role in defining the mdgs through the development assistance committee, especially through its publication “shaping the 21st century”. we are well placed to make an equally significant but different contribution to the discussions, led by the united nations (un) today.in our view, the main features of a post-2015 framework:• none should be relevant to a broad constituency of countries. the distinction between “developed” and “developing” countries is, to a large extent, the heritage of a by-gone era. the ambition and scope of the post-2015 framework should be relevant for and appeal to an increasingly heterogeneous world, accommodating the aspirations and priorities of people worldwide.• none should be based on a holistic approach to development. development is more than economic growth coupled with poverty reduction. it should also recognise other aspects that make life decent and worth living. it should recognise the importance not only of average achievements within each country but also of inequalities in each dimension of life.• none and should have measurable, country-owned goals that make empirical sense. as we experienced in the past, setting goals without having the data and a statistical system in place to track progress is ineffective. as new york city mayor bloomberg often says, “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”more than ever development is a global concern. we have a unique opportunity to revise and revamp development policies. we are going to need new tools, strong leadership, inclusive multilateral cooperation and the active participation of civil society.the relation with entities such as the berlin civil society centre takes on a greater significance in this context. you bring together key international csos across the board of public policy and you can help us in asking the right questions and in developing effective solutions. i very much look forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions.
976@Public policy and resource allocation: evidence from firms in OECD countries@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/public-policy-and-resource-allocation_5k9158wpf727-en@the correlation between a firm’s size and its productivity level varies considerably across oecd countries, suggesting that some countries are more successful at channelling resources to high productivity firms than others. accordingly, we examine the extent to which regulations affecting product, labour and credit markets influence productivity, via their effect on the efficiency of resource allocation. our results suggest that there is an economically and statistically robust negative relationship between policy-induced frictions and productivity, though the specific channel depends on the policy considered. in the case of employment protection legislation, product market regulations (including barriers to entry and bankruptcy legislation) and restrictions on foreign direct investment, this is largely traceable to the worsening of allocative efficiency (i.e. a lower correspondence between a firm’s size and its productivity level). by contrast, financial market under-development tends to be associated with a higher fraction of low productivity relative to high productivity firms. furthermore, stringent regulations are more disruptive to resource allocation in more innovative sectors, though the nature of innovation turns out to be important.

979@First meeting of the New Approaches to Economic Challenges (NAEC) Group@http://www.oecd.org/economy/firstmeetingofthenewapproachestoeconomicchallengesnaecgroup.htm@opening remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the first meeting of the new approaches to economic challenges (naec) groupparis, wednesday 24 october 2012(as prepared for delivery)ladies and gentlemen,we are now into the fifth year of the greatest economic crisis of our lifetimes and still wrestling with its dire consequences. according to the latest oecd interim assessment, the global economic outlook has deteriorated significantly since last spring. several european countries are entering a recession. the united states is projected to have somewhat stronger growth, but failure to avoid the fiscal cliff might derail its recovery. china’s exports, meanwhile, are being hit hard, and growth is slowing.this outlook is grim news for the more than 200 million unemployed around the world. in oecd countries, unemployment is likely to remain at 7.7% in 2013 – with some 48 million people out of work. all this is happening against a background of increasing inequalities in advanced and many emerging economies. and several countries, having accumulated vast amounts of debt, are under immense pressure to put their public finances back on a sustainable footing.thus, a simple return to “business-as-usual” is not an option. we urgently need to revisit models and theories to question conventional wisdoms and “established truths” to see where they have fallen short.this is our objective and ambition with a new oecd initiative called “new approaches to economic challenges”. we will examine what lessons can be learned from the crisis and what policy implications can be derived from these lessons as we address the challenges going forward. the main goal is to enrich our analytical frameworks, while identifying a renewed strategic policy agenda for inclusive growth and well-being.how can this be accomplished? and where do we begin?we clearly need to be open to drawing pertinent and sometimes difficult conclusions from the crisis. naec is not an exercise in self-flagellation or navel-gazing because we need to examine where we could have connected better the warning signals in the lead-up to the crisis, where we could have rung the alarm bells louder – perhaps in co-ordination with other international organisations.we also need to examine where our analytical tools failed and how they can be improved. and where the crisis and the underlying vulnerabilities it exposed calls for us to take a closer look at the unintended consequences of some of our policy recommendations. though already underway in many of our policy committees, naec offers the opportunity for more systematic, cross-cutting and deeper reflection.when we say “go structural, go social, go green,” we need to look at the underlying pressures as a result of major global trends that have been building up for decades. while none were the immediate cause of the current crisis, some may have contributed to the vulnerabilities that led to it. all of these pressures will condition the prospects for recovery, long-term growth and well-being. these trends include rapid global economic integration and technological innovation, population ageing and demographic shifts and climate change.these and other trends are fundamentally transforming our economies and employment prospects, compromising already fragile fiscal situations and putting further pressures on the environment and natural resources. due to limitations, traditional policy tools and frameworks are a poor fit to address these challenges or harvest new opportunities posed by such transformations. they will also condition the policy environment for new financial sector reforms and macroeconomic, social, employment and a whole range of other policies that need to occur.this begs the question, what kind of new frameworks exist to better examine the policy trade-offs between competing objectives in an integrated manner? how do we implement them, and what kinds of data will we need? how do we manage risks? and how do we move from a narrow focus on growth towards operationalising a broader notion of well-being and inclusiveness?these issues, again, are very much at the heart of the naec agenda.ladies and gentlemen, naec has struck a chord – with our ministers, governments, policy committees, staff, and the broader expert community - as witnessed by the distinguished experts who have agreed at very short notice to speak at today’s seminar.this level and intensity of interest is truly unprecedented.we need to capitalise on this interest, this wealth of expertise and diversity of policy expertise assembled in this room and beyond.in the first three sessions today, we will focus on whether and how the objectives for macroeconomic, financial and social and employment policies have been affected by the crisis experience and not least, how the crisis has affected the way that these objectives should be pursued. the fourth session identifies a number of important long-term trends that will further affect how policy objectives are best pursued. the discussion in this session will attempt to not only draw out the implications of these trends for policies, but also how the trends themselves may be affected by policies.as i open this meeting, i ask each of you to bear in mind one simple question as the day's discussions unfold – how do we translate insights from today into an operational, analytical agenda for the oecd?we will come back to this question in the various sessions and particularly the final wrap-up session. let me thank all our high level speakers for being with us today. we really appreciate your presence and your contribution to this fascinating endeavour.with that, i pass the floor to deputy secretary general and chief economist pier carlo padoan for session 1: revisiting macroeconomic goals.
980@Measuring well-being needs to be at the heart of policy-making, says OECD World Forum@http://www.oecd.org/economy/measuringwell-beingneedstobeattheheartofpolicy-makingsaysoecdworldforum.htm@"19/10/2012 - a major step forward towards putting the measurement of well-being at the heart of policy-making was taken at a four-day international conference which ended in new delhi today.experts and policy makers from fields as diverse as the environment, development, health and education, discussed the progress achieved and improvements needed in the way we monitor and analyse our changing societies. the oecd’s world forum on measuring well-being for policy-making and development also took stock of the substantial level of work being undertaken internationally to broaden our notions and assessment of progress beyond the limits of traditional indicators such as gdp (gross domestic product).oecd chief statistician martine durand said developing new indicators was well advanced in a number of areas, such as the material conditions of households, in several quality of life domains and in the field of environmental accounting. but she added that major measurement challenges remain – both at the conceptual level (governance and social cohesion) and at the more technical level (gdp and prices; inequalities and mental health). ensuring the timeliness of important indicators was also critical, she said.pointing out that india's per capita gdp is 10 per cent of the oecd average, montek singh ahluwalia, deputy chairman of india’s planning commission emphasized the particular challenge facing developing nations:“at this level of per capita income, there is no question that doubling or tripling the gdp would go a long way towards meeting many of the multi-dimensional objectives that contribute to well-being. at india's income level, ignoring gdp entirely would be impossible. but gdp simply measures goods produced. it does not measure the negative externalities, such as damage to the environment and bio-diversity, pollution, and over-exhaustion of limited natural resources. these problems have now reached a scale where they cannot be ignored.”jeffrey sachs of columbia university’s earth institute warned of the dangers of neglecting the ecological dangers facing the planet. “if you are not scared, you are not well-informed,” he said and called for accurate and systematic monitoring of man’s impact on the environment.oecd secretary-general angel gurría said the economic and financial crisis had meant policy-makers must learn from previous mistakes. referring to the oecd’s ‘better life initiative’, he said: “we have put the notion of well-being beyond just gdp to incorporate other dimensions like the quality of the environment, health, the strength of communities and the responsiveness of our institutions. measuring progress also takes into account equity considerations and sustainability.”nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz said: “our metrics are important not just because they tell us how we are doing but because they serve as guides in policy-making.”a statement issued at the conclusion of the conference said a strengthened link between statistics, knowledge and policy requires engagement from civil society, the business community, statisticians, academics, and politicians. read the concluding statement.for further information, consult http://www.oecd.org/site/worldforumindia/ or contact the oecd media division (news.contact@oecd.org; tel.: +33 1 45 24 81 03)"
981@Promoting SME development in Indonesia@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k918xk464f7-en@micro, small and medium-sized firms (msmes) are a key source of employment and economic growth in indonesia. they contributed to the country’s economic resilience during the 2008-09 financial crisis. but many suffer from low productivity, curbing their role in boosting living standards. there are several ways to spur msme productivity growth over the medium term. the first route would be to encourage the formalisation of small firms. lessening red tape through simplification of the licensing process and lower tax compliance costs would help. avoiding excessive rises in the minimum wage in provinces where it is already at a reasonable level would also be important. looking forward, it would be useful to remove rigidities in the formal labour markets, while moving to some form of unemployment benefit system to insure workers against job-loss risks. the second route would be to boost investment. clarifying property rights for real estate, and making the information collected by the credit bureau available to all financial institutions would ease access to finance. at the same time, the development of financing alternatives such as venture capital, leasing or micro-finance would enhance credit supply. the poor state of infrastructure, in particular in the transportation and electricity sectors, is also perceived as an important impediment to investment and could be remedied by increasing public infrastructure spending on cost-effective projects. the third route would be to enhance the quality of human resources. the country suffers from a lack of skilled workers, and policies should aim both at increasing the pool of workers and making education and training institutions more responsive to evolving labour-market demand. indonesia has a long tradition of supporting msmes. but responsibilities between the different levels of government and within the central government need to be clarified to minimise overlap and inefficiencies. a rigorous assessment of existing programmes would allow schemes to be consolidated and scarce public funds to be directed to their most cost-effective uses.
982@Public debt, economic growth and nonlinear effects: myth or reality?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k918xk8d4zn-en@the economics profession seems to increasingly endorse the existence of a strongly negative nonlinear effect of public debt on economic growth. reinhart and rogoff (2010) were the first to point out that a public debt-to-gdp ratio higher than 90% of gdp is associated with considerably lower economic performance in advanced and emerging economies alike. a string of recent empirical papers broadly validates this threshold value. this paper seeks to contribute to this literature by putting a variant of the reinhart-rogoff dataset to a formal econometric testing. using nonlinear threshold models, there is some evidence in favour of a negative nonlinear relationship between debt and growth. but these results are very sensitive to the time dimension and country coverage considered, data frequency (annual data vs. multi-year averages) and assumptions on the minimum number of observations required in each nonlinear regime. we show that when non-linearity is detected, the negative nonlinear effect kicks in at much lower levels of public debt (between 20% and 60% of gdp). these results, based on bivariate regressions on secular time series, are largely confirmed on a shorter dataset (1960-2010) when using a multivariate growth framework that accounts for traditional drivers of long-term economic growth and model uncertainty. nonlinear effects might be more complex and difficult to model than previously thought. instability might be a result of nonlinear effects changing over time, across countries and economic conditions. further research is certainly needed to fully understand the link between public debt and growth.
983@Portugal: rebalancing the economy and returning to growth through job creation and better capital allocation@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k918xjjzs9q-en@portugal: rebalancing the economy and returning to growth through job creation and better capital allocationlow growth and huge current account deficits have characterised the portuguese economy over the past decade. easy credit in global markets, combined with the absence of incentives to limit loan-to-deposit ratios until recently, made it possible to finance internationally high levels of consumption and investment relative to gross domestic product (gdp) through over reliance of the banking sector on wholesale funding. this led to high households’ and firms’ indebtedness and made banks vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. however, investment and credit were mostly directed to sheltered sectors, giving rise to an oversized road infrastructure, electricity generation capacity and housing stock. weaknesses in labour market institutions further held back productivity and hampered wage adjustment, making it harder to gain cost competitiveness. the deleveraging process set in motion by the loss of access to foreign financing is helping to rapidly reduce external deficits, but also has the potential to generate a damaging credit contraction, which enhances the importance of alternative financing strategies for firms, such as greater reliance on equity. to restore growth, portugal needs to foster the reallocation of both labour and capital, essentially towards the tradable sector. building on recent policy initiatives or commitments, this will require reforming public policies that have long distorted investment allocation, ensuring that banks adequately recognise and provision problematic loans and, on the employment front, reducing labour market segmentation and increasing targeted training. reforms in wage setting, labour taxation, unemployment benefits and activation policies will foster job creation, thus enhancing output growth while avoiding high unemployment becoming entrenched and threatening social cohesion. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of portugal (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/portugal).g21: financial economics / financial institutions and services / banks; depository institutions; micro finance institutions; mortgages; j64: labor and demographic economics / mobility, unemployment, vacancies, and immigrant workers / unemployment: models, duration, incidence, and job search; j52: labor and demographic economics / labor-management relations, trade unions, and collective bargaining / dispute resolution: strikes, arbitration, and mediation; collective bargaining; f32: international economics / international finance / current account adjustment; short-term capital movements; l94: industrial organization / industry studies: transportation and utilities / electric utilities; j65: labor and demographic economics / mobility, unemployment, vacancies, and immigrant workers / unemployment insurance; severance pay; plant closings; g28: financial economics / financial institutions and services / financial institutions and services: government policy and regulation; r31: urban, rural, regional, real estate, and transportation economics / real estate markets, spatial production analysis, and firm location / housing supply and markets

985@Choosing the pace of fiscal consolidation@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/choosing-the-pace-of-fiscal-consolidation_5k92n2xg106g-en@in many oecd countries debt has soared to levels threatening fiscal sustainability, necessitating its reduction over the medium to longer term. this paper uses stylised simulations in a small, calibrated macroeconomic model which features endogenous interactions between fiscal policy, growth and financial markets. simulations are done for a hypothetical economy, reflecting key characteristics of fiscally stressed oecd countries. given the assumed objective to stabilise debt at a 60% of gdp target within 20 years, a consolidation path is chosen by maximising cumulative gdp growth and minimising cumulative squared output gaps. the simulations highlight four issues. first, lowering the debt-to-gdp ratio within a finite horizon requires big initial consolidation which can be largely unwound if debt is to be stabilised at a lower level. second, some frontloading of the adjustment turns out to be optimal in case of an interest rate shock. third, debt reduction with high fiscal multipliers, hysteresis effects and adverse market reactions involves protracted large negative output gaps and deflation. this stresses the importance of selecting reasonable fiscal targets consistent with market conditions. fourth, delaying the attainment of the debt target by two years has generally little implications for initial consolidation, though under adverse conditions this would result in much higher debt and slower growth.
986@Estonia must reform to ward against boom/bust cycles, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/estoniamustreformtowardagainstboombustcyclesoecdsays.htm@"01/10/2012 - estonia recovered forcefully from the global economic crisis but growth has since slowed, highlighting the need for further reforms that reduce exposure to external shocks and ensure against future boom/bust cycles, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of estonia.the report, presented today in tallinn by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and estonian prime minister andrus ansip notes estonia’s resilience, despite the continuing slowdown across europe. the oecd projects estonian economic growth of around 2.2 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2013.“over the past decade, estonia has achieved one of the highest medium-term growth rates in the oecd, accompanied by rapid improvements in living standards,” mr gurría said. “it is in good times that we prepare for future storms, which is why estonia should begin implementing reforms today to make it even more resilient to future shocks. reducing the considerable volatility that estonia has experienced is key to ensuring sustainable growth and well-being over the long term.” (read the full speech)the oecd identifies three priorities for future action.first, more effective supervision of financial markets would help estonia ward against excessive credit cycles driven by foreign-financed lending. while micro-prudential regulation of financial markets is well established, existing macro-prudential instruments were insufficient during the build‑up of the recent boom/bust cycle. cross‑border co‑operation of financial sector regulation needs to be further strengthened, particularly as estonia is so integrated into the nordic regional banking market.“within these frameworks for cooperation, it will be important to consider how macro-prudential tools, such as countercyclical capital buffers, can be best designed and implemented to ensure the stability of the estonian economy,” mr gurría said.second, the oecd says that fiscal policy can also be a key line of defense against boom/bust cycles, noting that spending ceilings could be used to contain increases in government outlays during boom times. such a ceiling would constrain over-spending in boom years, but would also allow automatic stabilizers (mainly on the tax side) to operate during downturns. the planned establishment of an independent fiscal institution is seen as a key step forward, but the oecd points out that such institutions must have a clear mandate, be adequately funded and fully independent.a third priority should be improving the effectiveness of social protection, labour market and education policies, to support the most vulnerable and tackle unemployment and skill mismatches, particularly among young people, who have been hard-hit by the crisis. a switch to more activation oriented, and better-targeted policies, as well as support for life-long learning, will help promote more sustainable and inclusive long-term growth.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd’s media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."

989@China: Trade and product markets@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k92pgjgll7l-en@this paper explores the productivity impact of trade, product market and financial market policies over the last decade in china – a fast growing country where, despite significant reform action, regulatory stance remains still far from oecd standards. the paper makes a critical distinction between downstream and upstream industries, focusing on the indirect effects of regulation in upstream industries on firm performance in downstream manufacturing industries. this framework allows investigating the link between these policies and productivity growth depending on how far incumbents are relative to the technological frontier. the analysis is novel in several respects. drawing on new oecd policy indicators of sector-level product market regulation and firm level data, econometric estimates deliver new evidence on the potential gains from product and financial market reforms in china, two policy areas that had not been studied in previous empirical literature. firm-level microeconomic data further allow shedding light on the differential effects of policies within industries, while also highlighting the potential channels through which productivity is affected by reform. the key conclusion that can be derived from the empirical analysis is that further product, trade and financial market reforms would bring substantial gains in china and could therefore speed up the convergence process. taken at face value, the empirical estimates would imply that aligning product, trade and financial market regulation to the average level observed in oecd countries would bring aggregate manufacturing productivity gains of respectively 9%, 4% and 6.5% after five years. trade and product market reforms are found to deliver stronger gains for firms that are closer to the industry-level technological frontier, while the reverse holds for financial market reforms.
990@Canada: Tertiary education: developing skills for innovation and l-t growth@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k92pghq4247-en@the tertiary education system in canada performs well in fostering a skilled workforce with generally good labour-market outcomes and is internationally recognised for its research contributions. tertiary educational attainment is high, but participation rates will need to continue expanding to maintain the supply of highly skilled labour as the population ages and the needs of the knowledge-based economy rapidly evolve. this should be achieved by encouraging access to higher education for disadvantaged socio-economic groups, while enhancing the flexibility of the system to allow students with diverse needs to move between institutions more easily to meet their learning objectives. immigration is another important source of skills that could be better utilised. the development of skills for innovation can be improved by increasing the integration of technical, business and communications skills training with practical industry experience within tertiary education programmes. in an environment of government spending restraint, the quality of tertiary education could be strengthened by increasing the distinction between institutions that target research and those that emphasise teaching and re-evaluating tuition policies in provinces where public finances are stretched. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic review of canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/canada).

992@Intangible assets, resource allocation and growth: a framework for analysis@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/intangible-assets-resource-allocation-and-growth_5k92s63w14wb-en@this paper explores the growing importance of intangible assets as a potential source of innovation and productivity gains, and the contribution of efficient resource allocation to this process. realising the growth opportunities implied by intangible assets depends on the ability to reallocate labour and capital to their most productive use, which is determined by the design of framework policies. the redeployment of tangible resources takes on heightened importance given the inherent difficulties in allocating intangibles efficiently. indeed, the characteristics of intangible assets create market imperfections, which hinder the allocation of new ideas to where they can be developed most efficiently. while a number of policy instruments are typically deployed to address these market failures, the paper also explores how the growing importance of intangible assets is affecting the suitability of these policy tools. in turn, a number of policy issues are identified, spanning the financing of start-up firms, the treatment of intangibles in corporate valuation and accounting frameworks, competition policy in the digital economy and the role of intellectual property rights frameworks in rapidly growing domains such as information technology.
993@Structural reforms to boost Turkey’s long-term growth@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k92smv7cnjl-en@turkey can achieve strong sustainable growth and job creation but further reforms in the labour market, education and product markets are required for such gains to materialise. in recent years, growth has been largely driven by the industrial catch-up of anatolian regions, although the marmara area in the west has also been very dynamic. in the process, labour force participation has started to rise anew, but around one third of new low-skilled jobs have been created in the informal sector. sustaining vigorous growth over the longer run therefore requires pushing ahead with a number of structural reforms. first, turkey’s rigid labour market regulation needs to evolve, so as to encourage job creation in the formal sector. second, further progress with education reform, from pre-school all the way to the tertiary level and vocational training, is needed to boost growth and bring about employment gains in the formal sector. third, implementing product market reforms, notably in network industries, would unleash productivity gains in those sectors and be a boost to the rest of the economy. a set of alternative growth scenarios through 2030 illustrates how progress on these various fronts can deliver lasting improvements in living standards. this working paper relates to the 2012 oecd economic survey of turkey (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/turkey).

998@Avoiding debt traps: financial backstops and structural reforms@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k962hhtt5mr-en@in this paper we develop a simple analytical framework to analyze “good” and “bad equilibria” in public-debt and growth dynamics. the “bad equilibrium” is characterised by the simultaneous occurrence, and adverse feedbacks between, high and growing fiscal deficits and debt, high risk premia on sovereign debt, slumping economic activity and plummeting confidence, whereas a “good equilibrium” is characterized by stable growth and debt and low risk premia. we use this framework to identify – both theoretically and empirically – the good and bad equilibrium levels of debt and policies that can help a country caught in a bad equilibrium to recover. the analysis shows that despite some output loss in the short run fiscal consolidation can help countries escape from the bad equilibrium trap. more broadly, we find that a combination of financial backstops, structural reform and fiscal consolidation is most effective in helping countries getting onto a sustainable path.
999@Implications of output gap uncertainty in times of crisis@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k95xd7m3szw-en@this paper analyses the monetary and fiscal policy implications of output gap estimates in times of crisis. the widening of output gaps observed in major oecd economies in the wake of the recent crisis has been mainly due to total factor productivity gaps, except in the united states where it essentially resulted from a large increase in the unemployment gap. as indicated by “positive” taylor rules, output gaps influence policy-controlled interest rates and are in principle important indicators to guide monetary policy decisions. however, these gaps are estimated with a large margin of uncertainty, especially when composed mainly of tfp gaps. given the high uncertainty of output gap estimates at present, monetary policy should put more weight on alternative indicators of inflation pressure such as wage settlements, trends in unit labour costs and a wide range of indicators of inflation expectations. the recent fall in margins observed in some countries may, for instance, translate into a combination of wage moderation and upward price pressure as firms try to rebuild their margins. in the united states, the large unemployment gap could also keep wage inflation under pressure despite a flattening phillips curve. these downward pressures should not, however, trigger a deflationary spiral as long as inflation expectations stay anchored. as regards fiscal policy, output gaps remain necessary inputs to assess the fiscal stance adjusted for the cycle, such measures of underlying fiscal balances being reasonably robust to output gap uncertainty.

1002@An analysis of productivity performance in Spain before and during the crisis: Exploring the role of institutions@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k9777lqshs5-en@an analysis of productivity performance in spain before and during the crisisthe spanish economy experienced significantly weaker labour productivity growth than other oecd economies and failed to catch up with the most advanced economies in the period 1996-2007. in recent years labour productivity growth has accelerated, but this recovery is likely to be due to cyclical and temporary factors. the aim of this paper is to identify what factors weigh on weak trend productivity growth. the relatively weak performance largely reflects the low growth of total factor productivity within a wide range of sectors, with very limited impact of composition effects, while the capital stock and educational attainment of the workforce have grown relatively strongly. the paper investigates the role of some institutions in deterring innovation, competition and the growth of successful firms. it argues that spain needs to have a more flexible labour market and collective bargaining system to improve productivity performance. productivity performance would also benefit from a more flexible business environment in such a way that both entry and exit of firms in the economy are less costly, including a reform of bankruptcy legislation, steps to make civil judicial procedures more efficient and a greater reduction of barriers to entry into the retail trade sector.o4: economic development, innovation, technological change, and growth / economic growth and aggregate productivity; j24: labor and demographic economics / demand and supply of labor / human capital; skills; occupational choice; labor productivity; k0: law and economics / general
1003@Europe's new fiscal rules@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k9777md976b-en@europe is putting in place a new system of fiscal rules following the euro area sovereign debt crisis and decades of rising government to debt-to-gdp ratios. these include the so-called “six pack” to upgrade the stability and growth pact to a new treaty incorporating the “fiscal compact”. much of the discussion about the new rules has been procedural or theoretical. this paper shows what the rules will mean in practice under a realistic mediumterm scenario developed by the oecd. in the short term, fiscal consolidation will largely be driven by the current wave of excessive deficit procedures. only once these commitments are fulfilled will the new system of rules come into action. although the rules are complex, the central pillar of the new fiscal rules will be the requirement to balance budgets in structural terms. these imply a tight fiscal stance over the coming years for many european countries by comparison with the performance achieved in past decades: almost all countries will have to be as disciplined as the few countries that managed to make meaningful progress in tackling high debt levels in the past. a further tightening of budgetary medium-term objectives is likely in 2012, which will in many cases make the required fiscal stance even tighter. over the very long term, the rules imply very low levels of debt. the requirements can thus not be considered to be a permanent approach. the methodology to calculate the structural balance has a number of weaknesses and discretion will be needed in implementing the rules.
1004@Economy: The United States needs to foster education and innovation to keep its cutting edge@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economytheunitedstatesneedstofostereducationandinnovationtokeepitscuttingedge.htm@26/06/12 - the united states should do more to foster innovation and provide more equitable access to high-quality education in order to maintain its status as the world’s most vibrant and productive economy, according to oecd’s latest economic survey of the united states.data from the survey suggest the united states is losing its cutting edge in innovation. this affects prospects for long-term growth and for maintaining living standards. productivity in the u.s. is still growing faster than in most other oecd countries but growth has slowed down since the 1970s. also, u.s. companies are no longer more likely to innovate than companies in other oecd countries.particularly worrying is the performance in education, which is essential to provide workers with the skills necessary to become more productive and to adapt to technological change. attainment in tertiary education stagnated over the past three decades while it grew significantly in almost every other oecd country. today, 22 out of 30 oecd countries surveyed have more graduates in science and engineering among the 25 to 34 year old workers than the united states.“the united states is still one of the most innovative economies in the world but competition is growing and we need better policies to keep the u.s. at the frontiers of innovation”, said oecd deputy secretary-general richard boucher.the report recommends increasing the number of graduates in stem (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects by giving more students access to quality secondary education. cuts in the federal budget for research and development should be as limited as possible. ideally, the 2007 decision to double the budgets of three key science agencies within a decade should be implemented. further reforms in the patent law should promote innovation by limiting the possibility to extract disproportionate licensing fees for minor patented functions within complex products.to prevent long-term unemployment from becoming chronic, the survey suggests a greater focus on “active” labor market programs that help to facilitate job search and guide individuals towards training and education. these measures have proven to be effective even during periods of high unemployment and should complement existing “passive” benefit programs. the united states spends very little on activation policies relative to other oecd countries.the survey also highlights rising income inequality in the united states. the trend owes mainly to rising skill premiums and disproportionate income growth for top earners over the past two decades. high income inequality is also associated with low intergenerational social mobility. children born to low-income parents in the u.s. find it more difficult to move up the social ladder than in most european oecd countries.providing equal access to high-quality elementary and secondary education is essential to addressing this challenge. the survey also notes that the u.s. tax and benefits system is much less effective in reducing relative poverty than that of other oecd countries. this is largely the result of the limited and poorly targeted financial transfers to low-income households.the survey suggests that broadening the tax base through reduced tax expenditures, such as for mortgage interest, as well as harmonizing the tax treatment of different forms of capital income while simultaneously lowering the corporate tax rate could help to reduce income inequality and at the same time boost investment and long-term growth.for the short term, the survey recommends that monetary policy continues to support the recovery and that current legislation be amended to avoid a sharp fiscal tightening in early 2013. fiscal consolidation instead should be implemented at a gradual pace and as part of a medium-term framework to restore fiscal sustainability. the oecd projects that the u.s. economy will grow by 2.4% in 2012 and by 2.6% in 2013.>> further information on the economic survey of the united states is available at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/us. you are invited to include this internet link in coverage.>> to read and share the full report online from your computers, tablets or smart phones, please use: http://oe.cd/38.>> for more information journalists are invited to contact matthias rumpf at the oecd washington centre on +1 (202) 445 80 58.

1008@Promoting social cohesion in Korea@http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/promoting-social-cohesion-in-korea_5k97gkdfjqf3-en@korea faces the challenge of reversing rising inequality while sustaining robust economic growth. welltargeted increases in korea’s low level of social spending are needed to fill holes in the safety net, especially for the elderly. the development of social security depends on closing gaps in coverage, which are due in part to labour market dualism. dualism creates serious equity concerns, as non-regular workers face significantly lower wages, precarious jobs, less coverage by social security and less training. a comprehensive approach is required to break down dualism, including reduced employment protection for regular workers, improved social insurance coverage for non-regular workers and expanded training of non-regular workers. education reforms are also needed to promote inclusive growth, notably by: i) improving the access of low-income children to high-quality early childhood education and care; ii) reducing reliance on private tutoring, notably at hagwons; and iii) expanding income-contingent loans to tertiary students.

1015@Revitalising the Japanese Economy: The Way Forward@http://www.oecd.org/economy/revitalisingthejapaneseeconomythewayforward.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at a seminar organised by the research institute of economy, trade and industry (rieti)(as prepared for delivery)  minister edano, chairman nakajima, ladies and gentlemen,  it is a great pleasure to visit the research institute of economy, trade and industry (rieti), one of japan’s leading policy research institutes. i am honoured to be addressing this distinguished audience together with you, minister edano.  the world economy is still facing challenging times. the global recovery remains fragile, in many countries public finances are in a dire state, unemployment levels are still unacceptably high, while inequalities keep growing, both in developed and developing economies. we need to restore stability and confidence, we need to strengthen growth by making it durable and sustainable, both environmentally and socially. to do this we need a strong japan, with all its wisdom and economic strength.japan is in a special situation, having to cope not only with the consequences of the global crisis but also with the tremendous reconstruction challenges resulting from the great east japan earthquake.  this tragic event took a heavy toll of human lives and inflicted a massive economic damage, estimated at 3½ per cent of gdp. consequences of such magnitude require considerable time and a nation-wide effort of reconstruction. this is indeed the first component of prime minister noda’s “strategies to revitalise japan”, which we very much welcome and support.  a second pillar of the “strategies to revitalise japan” is to achieve both economic growth and fiscal health. japan’s fiscal problem has currently reached a critical point, with public debt at around 200% of gdp – the highest in the oecd area -- and rising.we have long stressed the need for a credible medium-term plan to achieve primary budget surplus by 2020. prime minister noda’s proposal to double the consumption tax rate is an important part of such a plan. it is crucial to have it implemented by 2014, if not before, in order to remedy japan’s vulnerable fiscal situation.  changes in the social security system also need to accompany the tax reform in order to limit spending pressure due to population ageing and thus ensure financial sustainability. bringing an end to 15 years of deflation would help to resolve the fiscal problem and to unleash japan’s growth potential. implementing and enhancing the new growth strategy.the “strategies for revitalising japan” call for implementing and enhancing the new growth strategy launched in 2010. a focus on growth is indeed necessary to close the gap in standards of living, which has been increasing in the last twenty years: japan’s per capita income is now 15% below the top half of oecd countries.  let me focus on two key aspects of the new growth strategy which we consider crucial: increased global economic integration and green growth.  in spite of the globalisation process that most economies have experienced throughout the past decades, japan is still relatively isolated from the world economy, with the lowest level of imports and inward foreign direct investment as a share of gdp among oecd countries, and the lowest share of foreign workers in its labour force.  the new growth strategy sets an ambitious objective of doubling the inflow of people, goods and capital by 2020, reducing barriers to trade, foreign investment and the movement of people into japan. increased openness is to be accomplished in part by negotiating economic partnership agreements with key trading partners. japan’s decision last november to participate in the discussions for a trans-pacific partnership – or tpp -- is a major step forward to an economic strategy based on “made by japan” rather than “made in japan”, as suggested by keidanren nearly a decade ago.  participation in the tpp has raised concerns about its potential impact on certain sectors, such as agriculture. but japan’s farm sector has a strong growth potential and the capacity to produce new, higher-value products. importantly, this is dependent on reforms to reduce the most market-distorting forms of support that impede farmers from fully exploiting this potential.  a second goal of the new growth strategy is to create 50 trillion yen (or more than 10% of gdp) of new demand through the development of green technologies. as suggested by the oecd green growth strategy, to encourage innovation and investment, japan needs market-based instruments – such as a cap-and-trade emissions trading system or a carbon tax - to put a clear and credible price on carbon. this would create the price signal needed to jump-start private-sector innovation in green growth and would generate revenue for the budget in support of fiscal consolidation.  these are two crucial sources of growth for japan, but there is a third one that we consider essential:japan’s productivity per hour of work is today about 30% below the top half of oecd countries. the experience of oecd countries and our skills strategy, to be released next month at our ministerial council meeting, show that human capital is key for innovation and productivity.  japan, for example, can do more to boost knowledge and skills. let’s be clear: education is outstanding in japan, both in terms of quantity and quality. japan is the second oecd country with more adult population with a higher education degree, at around 43% of total population.  however, there is still room for improvement. integrating childcare and kindergarten could yield positive results for the very young. investment in early education pays off: better educational outcomes earlier in life improve performance later on. universities could be upgraded through stronger competition and greater internationalisation. stronger co-operation among universities, government and research institutes would also enable higher education to make a greater contribution to innovation.  another important challenge for japan is to improve the currently relatively low productivity in the services sector through pro-competition reform. this could be done by reducing exemptions to the anti-monopoly act, increasing administrative fines and phasing out the special treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises.   finally, there is one last element that can make a remarkable contribution to revitalising japan: lifting employment through greater women’s participation  japan needs to address strong demographic headwinds. rapid population ageing will lead to a decline of japan’s working-age population by nearly 40% by 2050, reducing the number of working-age persons per elderly person to only 1.3.  to limit the decline in the labour force, the participation of underemployed individuals, notably women, will need to rise. indeed, the new growth strategy sets an objective of boosting the employment rate of women in the 25 44 age group from 66% in 2010 to 73% by 2020. improving opportunities for women is an important objective japan shares with many oecd countries.  the question is how can employment become more attractive to women? reducing the share of non-regular workers, of which 70% are women, would promote job stability and encourage on-the-job training, thus increasing human capital. moreover, it would lessen income inequality and relative poverty by reducing inequality in wages. indeed, the gender wage gap in japan is the second highest in the oecd area.japan also needs to make a greater effort to introduce family-friendly policies in order to help women combine work and family life. aspects of the tax and social security systems that discourage work by secondary earners should be reformed, while child-care should be improved and made more affordable.  but women are not the only the only segment of the population whose labour resources are underutilised. the human capital of older workers should also be used to its full potential through more flexible employment and wage systems that raise the age at which workers leave firms. attracting high-skilled foreign workers could be another way to limit the impact of a shrinking japanese labour force on the country’s long-term growth potential.  ladies and gentlemen, japan faces difficult challenges. but your response to the great east japan earthquake showed once again that japan is able to rise to very difficult tasks.  japan’s key strengths - a very well educated and hard-working population and a leading role in research and development - should play a key role in turning today’s challenges into opportunities for a better tomorrow. we look forward to joining forces with you in this historic moment.  thank you!
1016@Economy: Further reform needed to raise growth prospects in Poland@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economyfurtherreformneededtoraisegrowthprospectsinpoland.htm@"28/03/2012 - poland has been a strong performer across the oecd through the global economic crisis, growing much faster than most other countries and making impressive steps toward reducing the income gap with its european union partners. with the european economy now slowing, the country must take new measures to reduce government deficits, implement key reforms and lay the foundations for sustainable long-term growth, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of poland.the report, presented today in warsaw by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and polish deputy prime minister waldemar pawlak, warns that gdp growth will slow to below 3 percent during 2012-13, primarily as a result of weak activity in europe.  “poland’s strong economic performance in recent years is proof that appropriate macroeconomic policy combined with prudent regulation pays off,” mr gurría said. “now is the time for the polish authorities to promote innovative and green sources of growth and implement structural and social reforms that will continue promoting catch-up with the rest of europe while solidifying the confidence of financial markets in poland’s economic future.” ( read the full speech) more countries and data available in the excel filethe policy priority today should be growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, which is the best way to reduce vulnerabilities across the economy, the oecd says. lowering the budget deficit will help limit price pressures, keep external public debt under control and enhance fiscal credibility, all of which will alleviate contagion risks.  the government is expected to meet this year’s deficit target (2.9% of gdp in 2012), but more detailed measures will be needed to reach a 2% of gdp level in 2013 and the european union’s medium-term objective of 1% of gdp in 2015, the oecd said.  these will include cutting tax expenditures, reforming farmers’ social security system, implementing further pension reforms and enhancing public sector efficiency over the long-term.  in the event of a sharper-than-projected slowdown, poland could cushion the shock by easing monetary conditions, provided that the zloty does not weaken substantially, and by allowing automatic fiscal stabilisers to work within the limits allowed by the polish debt rule.  looking ahead, the oecd says poland can boost long-term growth by reducing the skills mismatch in the labour market and improving tertiary education. it should also continue seeking to ease administrative burdens on businesses and move ahead with the privatisation of state-owned companies.  the oecd report highlights a number of issues that must be addressed to improve outcomes and equity in the health-care system. these include widening the health care contribution base to secure adequate levels of funding and limit out-of-pocket payments, allowing new uses of private health insurance, reallocating funds from the hospital sector into primary care and better regulating doctors in both public and private institutions.  a special chapter of the report recommends that poland adopt more efficient environmental policies to promote green growth and help minimise the abatement costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. imposing an economy-wide single carbon price and maintaining the current uniform support to renewable sources of power are key to minimising overall abatement costs. government policies to increase the production of nuclear power and natural gas from shale formations should fully consider environmental costs and risks.  further information on the economic survey of poland, is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/poland. you are invited to include this internet link in coverage.  journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd’s media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."
1017@Economy: Bigger euro bailout fund needed to create space to boost growth, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/economybiggereurobailoutfundneededtocreatespacetoboostgrowthoecdsays.htm@27/03/2012 - euro area finance ministers meeting this week need to boost the firepower of the european stability funds to at least one trillion euros, oecd secretary-general angel gurría said today.  the current level of commitment to the rescue funds is not enough to restore market confidence, he said. a credible financial firewall will provide governments with the breathing space they need to focus crucially on revitalising europe’s economic growth and competitiveness.  “weak financial conditions, fiscal consolidation and economic adjustment are restricting demand in the short-term before the long-term benefits on stability and growth are felt,” mr gurría said. “decisive action to restore confidence and support demand is needed now.” (read the full speech).  presenting the oecd’s economic surveys of the euro area and the european union in brussels, mr gurría said: “the recent measures already taken to strengthen fiscal discipline, provide liquidity and implement growth-enhancing reforms – particularly in greece, italy, portugal and spain - are important advances towards a brighter economic outlook, but the challenges remain daunting.”  the economic, fiscal and financial imbalances of the area have led to weak bank balance sheets, high unemployment and low growth.   the survey calls for an ambitious programme of reforms in product and labour markets, tax systems and education to rebalance the economies, restore competitiveness , boost growth and bring down stubbornly high levels of unemployment – particularly among the young. it argues many reforms would stimulate growth even in the short-term.  “europe is stalling. it needs to get out of first gear and make growth the number one priority, ”said mr gurría.  to boost economic activity at the eu level, a step change in the political commitment to the single market is needed. the oecd says national regulations, rigidities and poor implementation of existing eu rules are frequently holding back cross-border economic activity, growth and job creation, and are undermining the eu economy’s efficiency and competitiveness. greater progress is needed in opening services markets. the report calls for an annual review for each country of the obstacles to benefitting fully from a market of 500 million consumers.  despite some 24 million unemployed people across europe, most eu countries expect growing skill shortages in certain sectors. labour mobility within europe is low. the eu should encourage migration in order to help workers and firms to achieve the most productive job matches.   the two surveys highlight the need for europe to make fundamental changes to financial supervision and regulation. europe needs an effective system of crisis resolution and excessively close ties between domestic banks and governments need to be undone.  to obtain copies of the two survey, or for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 9700); or visit; www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/euroarea and www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/eu.
1018@Going for Growth and Balance in Europe@http://www.oecd.org/economy/goingforgrowthandbalanceineurope.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered to the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament  brussels, 26 march 2012 (as prepared for delivery)  honorable madame chair, honourable members of the european parliament, ladies and gentlemen,  it is a great honour to address the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament. i am addressing this committee for the first time, but i see this as the starting point of an intensified dialogue and look forward to future occasions and exchanges.  over the last four years we have lived and worked under the impact of the greatest economic crisis of our lifetimes. we had to come to grips with the vagaries of financial markets, find new solutions to unprecedented financial, economic and employment challenges, all while trying to restore confidence, give people hope and maintain democratic and institutional legitimacy.we are not out of the woods yet: addressing the short-term challenges in the last weeks the fog has cleared a bit. recent actions in europe have produced a solution for greece that has calmed markets, the ecb has assured the necessary liquidity for the banking sector, and countries like italy, spain, portugal and the uk have committed to fiscal consolidation and major reforms. across the atlantic, the us economy shows again ‘green shoots’ of growth.  but we cannot sound the “all clear” yet. there are still pending issues derived from the crisis, confidence in the markets is still shaky, and more than anything, the long-term growth perspective of europe in a competitive global environment is muted.  indeed, we have yet to get to the the heart of this crisis, to the build-up of excessive financial, fiscal and economic imbalances during the upswing of the credit cycle. resolving the legacy of high debt, strengthening competitiveness and balance and creating jobs is the major challenge for governments and institutions in europe.  confidence in the ability to decisively address the sovereign debt crisis is still fragile. we are looking forward to the informal ecofin later this week and recall the need for a stronger “firewall” to stop contagion risk and reassure markets. we need the “mother of all firewalls” to shock the markets positively with overwhelming firepower and, thus, reduce the changes that you ever have to use it.  shifting wealth can also be an opportunity to reinvent europe’s strengths as much as the euro crisis and concerns about growth and employment in europe absorb our attention – we cannot close our eyes to new global realities. over the last ten years developing and emerging-market economies have greatly increased their contribution to global growth, shifting the economic centre of gravity to the south and the east.  developing and emerging-market economies now account for nearly 50% of world gdp, a far cry from the 36% that these countries represented when the oecd was created in 1961. even though their growth propects are linked to yours -as we have seen lately-, their economic dynamism and competitiveness are exceeding those of more advanced regions like europe. calculations suggest that trend growth for the eu is around 1.5 % per year, while growth of potential would be above 2% for the us and emerging countries are growing much faster, perhaps as much as 8 or 9 % for india and china. that’s what we call “shifting wealth”.  in the battle to nurture and attract the best brains, europe faces stiff competition from the us, canada or australia for the smartest students from india or china and for the most qualified immigrants. in education, students from shanghai and other chinese provinces are outperforming their european peers in pisa rankings.  at the same time the eu lags behind the best performers in the oecd in terms of productivity, employment rates and labour market participation. investment has been declining in many european countries and innovation spending is lower than in japan or the united states. in short, all this amounts to a massive wake-up call to action for growth and jobs. a true “sputnik moment”.  higher productivity growth is needed both for europe to compete in the challenging international economy as well as to address social challenges. weak growth performance has gone hand-in-hand with growing social problems, slow growth in real incomes and rising inequality. 24 million people in the eu are unemployed today, with youth unemployment reaching nearly 50% in greece and spain.  growth and jobs with a “policy agenda for competitiveness and balance in europe” given that growth and jobs are more difficult to generate when the space for fiscal and monetary policy is limited, europe needs an agenda for competitiveness and balance to respond to the growth and jobs challenge. this means that we have to concentrate on structural reforms that increase productivity and labour force participation by opening service sectors, by reforming health and pension systems, by making labour markets more flexible and raising skills or by facilitating innovation and entrepreneurship.  we also need a robust financial sector that contributes to sustain growth. ambitious structural reforms are not only needed to reignite growth in a recession-struck european union. they are especially crucial to address the rigidities that contributed to create the imbalances in the first place and to help avoid or be better prepared to deal with future shocks. thus, we need a new compact for competitiveness in europe. in this effort, the oecd can help, bringing the experience not only of its own european members, but those of the rest of the world that can be a source of inspiration and comparison. we are working with italy and spain to restore competitiveness, but we are at the full disposal of all members and of the european union and the european commission to implement ambitious reforms in many sectors.  let me draw your attention, for example, to a driver of growth, the single market. the single market is one of the proudest achievements and one of the most significant assets of the european union. but the potential of this market of 500 million people is far from fully exploited. particularly in the services industry, the eu-market remains fragmented. three elements are key for a truly integrated european economy: first, existing single market requirements need to be implemented more effectively;  second, europe needs a much more coherent and consistent framework for cross-border economic activity.  third, more progress is needed in a range of specific areas from cross-border government procurement to the development of europe-wide smart infrastructures and improved labour mobility. only 3% of working-age eu citizens live in another eu country. with 5% of the working-age population, migration from outside the eu is larger than migration within. this makes it hard for workers and firms to achieve the most productive job matches.  for the economy, this situation allows some regions to overheat, while unemployment stays high in others. policies are needed to make the eu labour market work better – for example through better recognition of professional qualifications and portability of public and private pension entitlements. at the same time, the eu needs to focus on how to avoid brain drain from europe, while managing to attract high skilled workers to help it compete globally.  to sum- up: it will be key for european policy makers and institutions to lay now the foundations for future growth and jobs built on the following elements:• unleashing new sources of growth, such as green growth, innovation and skills, which are crucial to maintain or regain competitive advantages for europe.• removing structural impediments to productivity growth in countries that lost competitiveness since the introduction of the euro and unlocking opportunities for investment, particularly in protected service sectors.• fostering greater and more effective utilisation of labour, tackling inequalities and investing in people’s skills and education. a particular focus needs to be put on ageing, which affects all countries in the european union.ladies and gentlemen, overcoming the economic crisis, charting the constitutional and institutional course for the european union, implementing structural reforms and generating growth are huge challenges. but a crisis offers just as many opportunities. winston churchill observed: ‘the pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.’   in this spirit, i wish the econ committee success in your important work, and i reiterate the readiness of the oecd to upgrade its cooperation with europe in its quest for better economic and social performance. count on us to design, promote and put in place better policies for better lives. thank you very much!
1019@Hungary must stabilise its economy for a durable recovery, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/hungarymuststabiliseitseconomyforadurablerecoveryoecdsays.htm@"13/03/2012 - swift action is needed to stabilise the hungarian economy and put growth on a sound footing for a durable recovery, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of hungary. the oecd report, released today in budapest, shows that the fragile and highly-indebted hungarian economy has been hard hit by the global slowdown and heightened financial market stress. it points out that controversial domestic measures have added to the uncertainty that is undermining business, household and market confidence.  “strengthening the credibility and predictability of domestic policies is essential to develop an environment that is conducive to growth and rising incomes,” the oecd says. an agreement with multilateral organizations for new financial assistance is a necessary step toward restoring confidence, the oecd said. a financial assistance package would support needed fiscal consolidation and lower hungary’s debt burden in foreign currencies by stabilising the exchange rate. the government should prioritize permanent spending cuts and structural reforms to boost growth, the oecd said. if additional revenues are needed, the least distortive taxes should be raised. fiscal consolidation efforts should be shared fairly across hungarian society.the credibility of any planned fiscal consolidation programme would be bolstered by providing the fiscal council with adequate resources to perform fiscal surveillance; by contrast, its excessive power to veto the budget should be removed, as it could potentially lead to a fall of government.  hungary should also take steps to reduce household debt. programmes to support household debt reduction should focus on distressed households, and ensure burden-sharing between lenders, borrowers and the government, to avoid damaging banks or provoking a credit crunch. the mid-december 2011 agreement with banks is a welcome step in the right direction, but is not sufficiently targeted to distressed borrowers.  raising growth should be a key medium-term objective. boosting labour force participation, particularly of under-represented groups, could be achieved by making it easier to combine work and families, better attuning the education system to labour market needs and reforming early retirement programmes. reforming the health system would improve outcomes and raise efficiency. promising avenues include reallocating resources from inpatient services to outpatient services, promoting prevention and healthy lifestyles and enhancing access to care.  further information on the economic survey of hungary is available at: http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/hungary.  journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."
1020@Structural reforms can make the difference as countries rebound from crisis, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/structuralreformscanmakethedifferenceascountriesreboundfromcrisisoecdsays.htm@"24/02/12 - structural reforms can make the difference as countries seek to rebound from the crisis, boost growth and create jobs, according to the oecd’s latest going for growth report. ""the crisis has acted as a catalyst for reforms. while they are sometimes unpopular, painful or both, they are necessary to make longer term growth stronger, more sustainable and more equitable,"" said oecd secretary-general angel gurría (read the full speech). ""we know that these efforts will pay dividends in the future, which is why governments must keep up the reform momentum,"" mr gurría said. mr. gurría presented the report in mexico city with mexico’s finance minister jose-antonio meade, ahead of the 25-26 february meeting of g20 finance ministers. he said the oecd’s country-specific structural reform recommendations are applicable to all g20 countries as they steer their economies out of the crisis.  since going for growth was launched in 2005, the annual report has identified key reform priorities to boost economic activity and raise living standards in each oecd country. since 2011, the report also addresses reform potential in brazil, china, india, indonesia, russia and south africa, and has been a key part of the oecd’s wider contribution to the g20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.the oecd report assesses and compares progress that countries have made on structural reforms since the start of the crisis, covering the 2007-11 period. it shows that the pace of reform has accelerated where it is needed most – in the european countries hardest hit by the sovereign debt crisis, including greece, ireland, portugal and most recently, spain and italy.the new european reform agenda has been spurred by the need to consolidate public finances and better manage pressures from the sovereign debt crisis. this has led governments to announce and begin implementing politically difficult yet ambitious reforms in areas including pension schemes, labour market policies and product market liberalisation. “structural reforms now underway in europe will eventually help reduce the economic imbalances that contributed to the debt crisis,” mr gurría said.going for growth encourages governments to push forward with policies to boost job creation, against a background of continuing fiscal consolidation. these include sheltering active labour market policies from budgetary cuts, easing regulatory barriers to firm entry in markets with strong, short-term job-creation potential like retail trade or professional services, and reforming tax systems in ways that are less harmful to employment and growth. governments should eliminate tax expenditures that do not promote growth, and shift the tax burden towards consumption, immovable property and environmental taxes. the long-term gains from reforms are sizeable: recent oecd work shows that a broad and ambitious reform agenda could lift gdp growth by as much as one percent annually on average across the oecd area over the next decade, while delivering sizeable gains for emerging-market economies as well. drawing on three decades of reform experiences, the report finds that concerns about adverse short-term effects of such reforms are overblown. indeed a number of structural reforms appear to boost growth fairly quickly, while usually very few if any have short-term costs. “the design and timing of reforms matters. a broad package of reforms delivers more quickly and strongly than a piecemeal strategy,” mr gurría said.further information on going for growth 2012 is available at: www.oecd.org/economy/goingforgrowth. detailed individual country notes are available on oecd and briics countries.for further information, journalists should contact lawrence speer in the oecd's media division (+33 6 80 14 05 46 or via email: lawrence.speer@oecd.org)."

1022@Germany is leading the charts on employment and green growth - Transition to a knowledge based economy will require further reform and investment, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/germanyisleadingthechartsonemploymentandgreengrowth-transitiontoaknowledgebasedeconomywillrequirefurtherreformandinvestmentoecdsays.htm@14/02/2012 - the german economy recovered rapidly from the 2008-09 recession, with gdp topping pre-crisis rates during 2011 and unemployment falling significantly. according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of germany presented today in berlin by oecd secretary-general angel gurría, germany has an impressive economic track record, but now faces a cyclical return to slower growth rates and challenges to lay the foundations for long-term growth.  the report cites numerous downside risks posed by the global slowdown, the deterioration of world trade and the euro area debt crisis. given the weight and importance of germany’s economy for europe, growth-enhancing structural reforms can make an important contribution to stronger and more balanced growth perspectives not only in germany but also in the euro area.in a long-term perspective, germany needs to transform its growth model to thrive as a knowledge-based economy. this transition requires policy efforts, investment and reforms in education, skills and innovation and continued leadership in green growth. but it also needs to work towards less burdensome regulations of services, increased labour participation of women and older workers and, thus, strengthening domestic demand. germany should also compare itself with other economies in the emerging world, and be ready to compete with countries that have been growing at higher rates for quite some time now.“germany’s recent economic performance has been exceptional, with low unemployment and solid growth. many other countries are looking at the german mix of labour market reforms, social partners’ constructive flexibility and sound fiscal policy,” mr. gurría said. “but moving ahead towards a knowledge based economy will require further policy reform. with the population ageing rapidly, more needs to be done to raise the medium- and long-term growth potential, notably through reforms that boost domestic demand, increase productivity growth and expand the labour force.” ( read the full speech )the oecd says that it is essential that germany allows automatic stabilisers to operate fully, as allowed under the new fiscal rule (schuldenbremse). reforms to further strengthen domestic demand should focus on improving the framework for investment and innovation in germany’s domestic sector. this should include lowering the strict regulation in some service sectors, notably professional services, and improving support for innovation through creation of an r&d tax credit.  germany should seek to build on its outstanding recent employment performance -, which was the result of substantial labour market reforms and flexibility – by raising labour inputs to avoid skill shortages. investing in skills, lowering fiscal disincentives to work for two-income households and further improving the supply of child care would encourage women to take up full-time work. employment of older workers could be promoted and labour migration could be better focused on economic needs, which would require lowering the hurdles for high-skilled migrants.  angel gurría,secretary-general of the oecd at the presentation of the survey in berlin, germany.
1023@FINANCE: Solving Europe's banking and debt crisis@http://www.oecd.org/economy/financesolvingeuropesbankinganddebtcrisis.htm@02/02/2012 - the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by the underpricing of risk in financial markets, threatening the banking industry worldwide. the emergency measures to save the industry led directly to the sovereign debt crisis in europe, which in itself has exposed structural weaknesses in economic governance, jeopardizing the very existence of the euro region. any attempt to avert an eventual fracturing of the currency union will need a set of policies that go further than the proposals currently under discussion. a true solution will look like this:  the european central bank should continue to support economic growth and investor confidence via term funding for banks and putting a lid on sovereign bond rates in key countries via its operations, including quantitative easing, well into the future.  the “greece problem” needs to be resolved once and for all with a 50% (or larger) haircut on its sovereign debt and necessary ancillary policies, so that its chances of remaining in the euro improve. policymakers and political leaders should pursue a growth strategy with a balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and the gradual achievement of longer-run “fiscal compact” rules, combined with clear structural reforms including bank restructuring and recapitalization, labour and product market competition, and pension system reform. without a growth strategy, the banking crisis is likely to deepen and the sovereign debt problems will worsen.  the recapitalisation of banks needs to be based on a proper cleaning up of bank balance sheets and resolutions where necessary. this can only be achieved with transparent accounting.  european banks are not only poorly capitalised, but also mix investment banking with traditional retail and commercial banking. risk exposures in large, systemically important financial institutions (sifis) cannot be properly quantified let alone controlled. adrian blundell-wignall, special advisor to the oecd secretary general on financial markets and deputy director of the directorate for financial and enterprise affairs. these activities have to be separated. retail banks where depositor insurance applies should not cross-subsidise high-risk-taking businesses; and these traditional banking activities should also be relatively immune to sudden price shifts in global capital markets. traditional banks need to be well capitalised with a leverage ratio on un-weighted assets of at least 5%. these policies will improve, not diminish, the funding of domestic smes on which growth depends.  the ecb cannot lend directly to governments in primary markets and it cannot recapitalise banks: the role of the european financial stability facility and european stability mechanism may be critical in providing a “firewall” via these functions; and it also provides an exit strategy mechanism for ecb holdings of sovereign debt on its balance sheet. the size of resources the efsf/esm may need for all potential roles, particularly bank recapitalisation, should not be under-estimated. this is not independent of what the ecb does, but it could be around € 1trillion.  the current efsf/esm resources of € 500 billion are not enough. furthermore, the efsf has not found it easy to raise funds at low yields, even with guarantees. if the size is not enough, then the paid-in capital and leverage ability may need to be raised and brought forward – the € 500 billion limit could apply to the esm and not be consolidated with the € 440 billion resources of the efsf. but if these structures as envisaged cannot raise enough funds from private investors, as seems likely, other funding sources will need to be brought in. the only plausible mechanisms are: a bank license to the efsf and credit from the ecb (and increasing leverage); the international monetary fund is a “bank” and the ecb could lend to them the appropriate sums; sovereign wealth funds could be cajoled with appropriate guarantees (possibly via the imf) to provide the funds.  implementing these policies, along with a focus on growth and structural change, provide a chance for europe to solve its problems without fracturing the eurozone. but this remains a risk.  leaving the currency union permits countries to convert credit risk into inflation risk: monetisation of their debt and an exchange rate route to a growth strategy. still, the cost for europe as a whole of such an outcome would be large, and it is to be hoped that this can be avoided.• the above article, published 2 february 2012 in the bloomberg brief: economics europe, is a summary of new oecd research available at: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/14/25/49481502.pdf
1024@External factors threaten Swiss economic recovery, OECD says@http://www.oecd.org/economy/externalfactorsthreatenswisseconomicrecoveryoecdsays.htm@"24/01/2012 - switzerland has made a broadly balanced recovery from the economic crisis but external factors are now weighing on the near-term outlook, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of switzerland. the report, presented today in berne by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and swiss federal councillor johann n. schneider-ammann, highlights substantial uncertainty going forward, especially in the context of the euro area crisis. while strong exports and investment-driven domestic demand boosted growth in 2010 and 2011, economic indicators now point to a pending period of slow growth linked to the crisis in europe, the oecd said. “switzerland is likely to suffer from decelerating activity in its trading partners, notably across europe, as well as from the pressures for appreciation of the swiss franc,” mr. gurría said. “declining exports may weaken gdp growth in 2012, so vigilance will be necessary to see the economy through these difficult times.” ( read the full speech).proposed reforms to regulation of the large, internationally active banks make substantial progress toward limiting potential risks from the financial sector. but a stricter leverage ratio requirement and a larger required share of highest-quality capital would have important benefits in terms of reducing risks at low cost for the economy, the oecd said. the oecd outlines how switzerland can use tax reforms to increase potential growth, reduce incentives for households to borrow and limit unwanted tax competition within the country. it calls for elimination of tax deductibility of household interest expenses from personal income tax; shifting tax burdens from personal income toward less-distortive taxes, like consumption taxes; and an end to limits on local governments’ ability to raise real estate taxes. a special chapter of the survey also highlights that meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets will require more cost-effective policies, in particular as concerns passenger road transport. further information on the economic survey of switzerland, is available here.journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."

1026@Growth perspectives for 2012@http://www.oecd.org/economy/growthperspectivesfor2012.htm@"remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the ""colloque risque pays coface 2012  paris, 16 january, 2012(as prepared for delivery)  ladies and gentlemen,  thank you for giving me the opportunity to open your annual seminar on country risk.  given current levels of uncertainty, it is quite a challenge to discuss the outlook for the global economy in the months to come. but i will take the risk, and share the oecd’s assessment of the forces shaping the near-term outlook, the risks surrounding our projections and the major policy challenges facing many oecd countries.  and, of course, i cannot avoid mentioning the challenges for the euro area, as we celebrate a ‘bitter-sweet’ 10th anniversary of the euro. the outlook for the global economywhen we published our latest oecd economic outlook in november, the global economic prospects were already very gloomy. at that time, we presented a scenario where oecd output was projected to grow by around 1.6 per cent in 2012 and 2.3 per cent in 2013. that scenario represented a significant downward revision from our previous projections and was predicated on the absence of disorderly sovereign defaults, systemic bank failures and excessive fiscal tightening in the united states.  since then, the global economic environment has deteriorated further. activity has lost impetus, even in the large emerging-market economies outside the oecd area, unemployment has edged up from already high levels in some countries, and financial market tensions have persisted. the euro area already appears to be in recession.  because the uncertainty around our projections was particularly large, we considered an even bleaker alternative. this darker scenario could be triggered by different events, including a worsening situation in the banking system, further contagion in euro area sovereign debt markets or excessively tight fiscal policy in the united states.  the bottom line is: in a situation of great uncertainty, all depends on policy action to restore confidence. prospects could be significantly brighter if measures were taken to solve the euro area sovereign debt and banking crises and a credible medium-term fiscal programme were enacted in the united states. as the economists put it, we could have multiple equilibria for the global economy, and appropriate policies could trigger a move from a “bad” equilibrium towards a “good” one.ten years after the launch of the common currency, the euro is facing its most severe test.  confidence in the monetary union is being shaken by lingering sovereign debt and banking crises. the european leaders have announced measures to stem contagion, to strengthen the banking system and to overhaul the governance of the euro area and to strengthen fiscal discipline in the years to come. a “fiscal compact” was announced at the leaders’ summit in december. these are important measures to restore the confidence needed to achieve our upside scenario. they will need to be implemented swiftly and decisively.  but there are also deeper underlying causes to the euro area crises, which need to be addressed. structural reforms, to rebalance growth and to restore competitiveness, need to be put in place as a matter of urgency. indeed, this is the crux of the matter.  to be more specific, the peripheral economies have lost competitiveness over the years, because of a gradual increase in the cost of labour and weak productivity growth. their external positions and public finances have deteriorated sharply as a result. by contrast, other countries in the euro area have gained competitiveness on the back of solid productivity gains and relied on external drivers to grow.   given the structural underpinnings of the euro-area crisis, it should not be a surprise that structural reforms tailored to specific country conditions lie at the core of the long-term resolution of the euro area woes. countries will have to rebalance their engines of growth, and this can only be achieved by removing structural rigidities within individual countries – in labour and product markets, for example – that hold back competitiveness and growth.  for example, reforms to liberalise sectors, such as retailing or professional services, which are often sheltered from competition, could contribute to rebalancing by unleashing opportunities for investment in those countries with large external surpluses. likewise, labour and product market reforms could foster productivity growth in those countries that have lost competitiveness and accumulated large external imbalances.  pro-growth reform also facilitates fiscal consolidation in countries with weak public finances. this is because faster growth generates revenue to the budget and is accompanied by lower spending on some programmes, including unemployment insurance.  to be clear, ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation will be necessary, given the level of indebtedness of some euro area countries. and indeed we have already seen steps in this direction in many countries. but it is an imperative to design adjustment packages in a growth-friendly manner. this can be done with a proper mix of expenditure and revenue measures.  on the expenditure side, for instance, higher public sector efficiency could allow for maintaining, or even increasing, outputs while reducing expenditure.  on the revenue side, broadening tax bases by reducing tax expenditures would enable a reduction in (marginal) tax rates and the associated economic distortions. improving the effectiveness in tax collection and the fight against tax evasion are other promising avenues. even if revenue neutral, tax reforms can also contribute indirectly to fiscal consolidation through their medium-term effects on income, productivity and tax receipts. in addition, policies to tax public “bads” such as pollution could help consolidation while creating opportunities for growth.since the onset of the crisis, the oecd has been working to help governments soften the blow on those who will be worst hit and to lay the foundations of a stronger global economy for the generations to come. we have identified country-specific policy actions that should be implemented if the global environment deteriorates further, to stabilise the financial sector, to protect the safety net, and to provide macroeconomic support while strengthening fiscal frameworks. in addition, a wide range of structural measures remain urgent, with priorities varying from country to country.  but let us be clear, in the current circumstances there is no more “business as usual”. it is not enough to “go structural”. it is also imperative to “go social” to deal with the social scars left by the crisis, including high joblessness and rising inequality, and to face the challenges posed by a slow recovery on the labour market. and this is not only a “mantra”. this is the only way to really invest in our future.   we thus call on countries to tackle resolutely the tragedy of unemployment, which risks becoming structural, and particularly youth unemployment, as we can neither accept nor afford a lost generation. youth unemployment stands at around 20% in oecd countries; it is higher still in france and reaches close to 50% in spain.we also call on countries to reverse the long-term trend of rising inequalities, which also lies at the heart of the current crisis. our recent report “divided we stand” provides powerful evidence that the benefits of growth do not trickle down automatically and that inequality does not foster social mobility. we thus need comprehensive strategies for inclusive growth.  ladies and gentlemen, to answer your initial question on the prospects for the global economy, i can only say, once again, that all will depend on policy action and leadership. but this is in fact good news. it means that we can put “better policies for better lives” at the centre of our policy efforts and tackle this crisis.  the road ahead is arduous. there is no shortcut. mais, comme l’a dit votre napoléon, “l'infortune est la sage-femme du génie ». let us hope that from this crisis, we will build a better world economy. thank you for your attention."

1028@Reform urgently needed to ensure long-term growth in Czech Republic, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/economy/reformurgentlyneededtoensurelong-termgrowthinczechrepublicsaysoecd.htm@"18/11/2011 - with the czech economy’s export-driven recovery slowing, swift implementation of new reforms is needed to ensure sustainable, inclusive long-term growth and better resilience to external shocks, according to the oecd’s latest economic survey of the czech republic.  the report, presented in prague today by oecd secretary-general angel gurría and czech prime minister petr necas, shows that the ongoing recovery has been weaker than in neighbouring countries, constraining the pace of convergence in income levels with more prosperous european countries. worsening trade performance and declining domestic demand will limit economic growth to 1.6 percent in 2012, down from 2.1 percent this year, with significant downside risks linked to the continuing international slowdown and the outlook for the euro area.  to counter these risks and boost economic activity, the oecd encourages the czech republic to maintain momentum behind reforms aimed at enhancing competitiveness and long-term growth. the reform programme should build on existing efforts to improve the business environment, strengthen the education system and promote innovation in line with the recently adopted competitiveness strategy.  “growth and improvements in living standards will depend on the transition to a more innovative, skill-based and energy-efficient economy,” said mr gurría ( read the full speech).  a special chapter of the survey underlines the need to strengthen the country’s fiscal framework through the introduction of an explicit debt target and the establishment of an independent institution to monitor and assess the state of public finances. the chapter also provides guidance for phasing in planned reforms in the health care and pension systems, including the creation of a new, voluntary, defined-contribution retirement pillar.  the oecd calls for economic transformation to foster energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. market-based instruments should be strengthened, excise tax rates on fossil fuels should be harmonised and support for renewable energies should be streamlined, all of which can improve incentives for changing the way producers and consumers use energy, the oecd said.  further information on the economic survey of the czech republic is available at: www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/czech. journalists seeking further information should contact the oecd media division: news.contact@oecd.org, +33 1 45 24 97 00."

1033@A fragile recovery@http://www.oecd.org/economy/afragilerecovery.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the forum of the americas  montreal, quebec, canada, 6th june 2011(as prepared for delivery)  commissioner, under-secretary, presidents, ladies and gentlemen,  it is a pleasure but also a challenge to conclude this inaugural session after such distinguished speakers. as you know, we have launched our new economic outlook 10 days ago. let me distil its main messages and discuss the longer-term policy challenges facing most oecd countries.  as already mentioned by previous speakers, the global recovery is becoming self-sustained and more broad-based. we project global output to grow by around 4¼ per cent in 2011 and 4½ per cent in 2012. as for canada, after more than 3% growth last year, we expect its output to continue at a healthy clip in the coming couple of years.  however, this global recovery is taking place at different speeds across countries and regions. most advanced economies are faced with sluggish growth, high budget deficits and high unemployment: nearly 50 million people remain jobless in the oecd area as a whole. in most emerging-market economies, by contrast, vibrant domestic demand growth and high commodity prices are generating inflationary pressures and prompting policy tightening.  this means that, although the recovery is under way, the outlook is not without risks. on the upside, the short-term stimulus from additional structural measures may be stronger than projected. private-sector activity may also benefit further from increasing confidence. on the downside, further increases in the price of oil and other commodities could hit disposable income. the chinese slowdown may also be more severe than projected. other downside risks are related to the unsettled fiscal situation in the united states and japan, weakness in housing markets, and continued financial and debt problems in some euro-area countries.  if these downside risks interact, their cumulative impact could weaken the recovery significantly. all this suggests that the global crisis may not be over yet.  this outlook calls for differentiated policy responses. in the advanced economies, structural reforms are needed to boost growth against a backdrop of fiscal consolidation and gradual monetary normalisation. in the emerging markets, the monetary stance needs to be tightened to curb inflation. structural reforms there could also make growth more sustainable and inclusive, while contributing to global rebalancing and enhancing long-term capital flows.  let me now focus on four longer-term policy challenges faced by oecd countries.  first, dealing with unemployment. steadfast policy action is needed to tackle high unemployment and prevent joblessness from becoming entrenched. this is among the most pressing legacies of the crisis. the recession offers some lessons on how to redesign and improve labour market policies. this includes, for example, more effective services and training to match workers and jobs, and well designed work-sharing agreements that can minimize employment loss in downturns.  in canada, government initiatives such as work-sharing, extended employment insurance benefits and training programmes helped cushion the impact of the recession on canadians, while keeping them attached to the labour market. with employment conditions improving, the government has appropriately begun to phase out these exceptional measures to reduce the risks of dependency. in the meantime, training programmes should be better targeted at the most vulnerable groups such as the long-term unemployed and low-skilled workers.  second, sustaining growth. experience shows that, following financial crises, there are risks of stagnation as structural adjustment and financial repair are delayed. stagnation could possibly also emerge from persistent deterioration of the structural and business environment. the potential for growth-enhancing structural reforms and policies to unleash new sources of growth is therefore substantial. and structural and innovation-friendly policies should contribute to making the economy greener, as discussed in the oecd green growth strategy, released last week in paris at our annual ministerial council meeting.  canada has a commendable track record in implementing pro-growth structural reforms. but it could lock in greater productivity gains through lowering restrictions on foreign direct investment, reducing barriers to competition in network industries, and further encouraging innovation, including through continued investment in education and research.  third, making progress in fiscal consolidation. high government indebtedness is another heavy legacy of the crisis, with government debt set to rise to just above 100% of gdp in the oecd area as a whole. this is about 30 percentage points above the pre-crisis level. consolidation requirements to merely stabilise debt are therefore substantial for many countries. and evidence shows that, beyond some threshold, high public indebtedness takes a toll on economic growth.  structural reforms can also contribute to fiscal consolidation. to illustrate, in the oecd area, a durable increase in employment rates by one percentage point through structural reforms could improve government budget balances by 0.3 to 0.8 percentage points of gdp. there is also massive potential for increasing the efficiency of public services through fiscal consolidation programmes. this would allow frontline services to be maintained at a lower cost. there could also be greater recourse to green revenue in fiscal consolidation programmes, including receipts from green taxes and carbon trading.  last, dealing with global imbalances. they are widening again as the global recovery gathers steam. but the composition of such imbalances is changing. china’s current account surplus is well below pre-crisis peaks due to adverse terms-of-trade movements and less buoyant export performance. at the same time, the current account surpluses of the high-saving oil-producing economies are mounting due to high oil prices.  structural policies have also an important impact on the size and composition of capital movements. one of the main current policy challenges in many countries is to reconcile open capital markets with the goal of coping with short-term instability through temporary measures. it is thus important that advanced and emerging-market economies agree on a framework that would allow such goals to be reconciled, including under the auspices of the g20.  ladies and gentlemen, we need to put together political will, talent, leadership and great communication skills to simultaneously tackle the challenges of unemployment, growth, fiscal consolidation and global imbalances. it is precisely the role of the oecd to help countries achieve such complex goals; to design better policies for better lives. count on us.  thank you for your attention.
1034@Stability And Growth: What Role For EU Cohesion Policy?@http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/stabilityandgrowthwhatroleforeucohesionpolicy.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general, delivered at the eu cohesion forum  brussels, 1st february 2011  ministers, commissioner hahn, dear colleagues, ladies and gentleman,  it is a great pleasure to address this important forum and discuss this crucial topic of regional policy. let me thank the eu commission and, in particular commissioner hahn, for the opportunity to share my views on the future of the european cohesion policy.  the european union faces serious challenges today, with public finances in poor shape, weak long-term growth prospects and an unemployment level close to 10%. in almost one-fifth of eu regions, more than one in eight workers is unemployed and inequalities affecting youth access to jobs are large. all this is dangerous for cohesion, be it economic, social or territorial. but the europe 2020 strategy sets out ambitious objectives to make the eu a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, echoing our oecd objectives of a stronger, cleaner, fairer global economy.how to breach the gap? regions are the place where policies can effectively complement each others to achieve these ambitious objectives. regional policy is the place for policy coherence. the cohesion policy will thus play a key role in meeting europe’s objectives and challenges. regional spending accounts for 36% of the eu budget. let me offer you the oecd’s perspective on how to get the best results from it.  it is first necessary to clarify an important point. propping up underperforming or inefficient economic sectors with fiscal support can no longer be a policy goal, not least in today’s budgetary situation. regional policies should thus focus on harnessing regional assets to generate strong and sustainable economic growth. as shown by the experience of countries like spain, robust economic convergence must come primarily from better integration into eu and world markets. the oecd therefore endorses the aims of the eu’s cohesion policy to stimulate endogenous growth and untapped development opportunities in all regions.  but a paradigm shift is needed in order to harness this growth potential. some argue that location doesn’t matter and that national policies are sufficient. we reject this view at the oecd and support a place-based approach. yes, location matters. whether resources are natural, human or intangible (such as culture), they are located in a geographic space.  once the approach to national growth becomes place-specific, sectoral policies need to be adjusted to the specific local economic, social and environmental conditions. we have underlined this need for greater differentiation of policy actions at national level and appropriate local institutions in our recent economic survey of the euro area.  more fundamentally, this place-based approach requires advanced and effective vertical and horizontal governance mechanisms. it implies a deep and coordinated engagement of regional and local governments in achieving national short- and long-term development outcomes.it also entails nurturing specific institutional arrangements to sustain the dialogue between the public and private sectors, academia and training institutions and community-based non-governmental organisations.  my main message today is that this place-based approach can help in achieving both short- and long-term objectives, starting with fiscal stability across the eu.  in the short term, sub-national governments have first an important role to play in fiscal consolidation. cities and regions face, indeed, great challenges in this regard. local tax revenues have decreased and central-government transfers drastically reduced, while demand for social services has been rising. faced with this “scissors effect”, sub-national governments are delaying or cancelling planned investment projects, while they are responsible for about 2/3 of all public investment in oecd countries!  the acceleration of the disbursement of their cohesion funds helped to cushion the impact of the crisis. it can now help to sustain long-term investment during a period of budgetary consolidation, particularly for countries in central and eastern europe. action is needed to make sure that all countries and regions access these funds fully and in a timely way.  the need for fiscal discipline at the local level leaves limited room for manoeuvre. countries and regions cannot afford to get it wrong with public investment. eu cohesion funds are in this context crucial to help balancing consolidation constraints with growth perspectives. but it is important that every euro be spent efficiently with visible outcomes for european citizens. this requires, in particular, avoiding the proliferation of small scale projects to try to satisfy everybody. it is also essential to build robust and transparent governance processes at all levels to improve the selection of projects and their effective implementation.  beyond cyclical considerations, regional policy can also contribute to long-term growth sustainability. policies that improve regional performance in a synchronised way could indeed have a substantial impact on aggregate growth potential. while a few large urban centres (4% of regions) contribute around 1/3 of aggregate growth in the oecd, the remaining smaller regions generate the remaining 2/3 of aggregate growth. regional policy should thus be a critical piece in an eu growth strategy.  why so? because regional policy is at the core of innovation, a key component of any growth strategy. here again, the landscape of technology-based innovation is not flat. around 13% of oecd regions account for half of its r&d investment, and our recent innovation strategy highlights that regions are nodes in global innovation networks. this calls for a place-based policy framework.  we will soon launch in brussels, with the european commission, a major report on regions and innovation policy. it provides a roadmap for how policies from different sectors and different levels of government can contribute to innovation-driven regional and aggregate growth.regional policy may indeed allow smes to benefit from the knowledge available within the universities and research centres in their regions. it can broker the emergence of regional networks linking up all key public and private actors. it can also build bridges with other national or global knowledge networks. as regional growth trajectories differ, so do the “smart” policy mixes each region needs to develop.  part of the rationale for encouraging innovation is the need for a transition to a low carbon and more resource-efficient economy. public finance and public policy will play a central role to enhance the risk-return profile of green investments, thus stimulating and laying the ground for the much needed private investment.  sub-national governments are here again pivotal, particularly to unlock policy complementarities. they can do so through an arsenal of innovative tools, such as greening public procurement; supporting greener local industries; raising consumer awareness; or catalysing r&d of green-tech clusters.this is evidenced by the role of cities, which have indeed been at the forefront of the green revolution. they can achieve economies of density and reduce the environmental pressures from the transportation and housing sectors.the city of chicago, for example, has reduced air pollution and energy costs from polluting industries by providing technical and financial support through its industrial rebuild program. in berlin, the local government supports energy services companies providing energy-efficiency retrofits to homes, repayable through future energy savings. in japan, kitakyushu has evolved from a high-polluting declining manufacturing region to become the country’s top industrial recycling centre.  beyond cities, green growth also offers tremendous opportunities for rural development. some rural regions have already developed systems that integrate energy production, heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy, such as gaspésie in québec, totara valley in new zealand, nord carelia in finland or colorado or nebraska in the us.  these actions by cities and regions require an integrated and coherent framework for investment across different areas – infrastructure, innovation, skills development, business support, etc. this is what regional policy is all about, and i am happy that this dimension is fully acknowledged in the most recent eu cohesion report.but for this to work, you need to make sure that the policy is properly implemented. the results of the eu’s cohesion policy will only be as good as its implementation. and this is a challenge. the 2007 to 2013 framework was a step forward in terms of focussing help on regions most in need, aligning regional policies with eu objectives and increasing the efficiency of delivery.in 2007, our economic survey already pointed the way to further improvements. key recommendations concerned the need to implement credible incentives for cohesion fund spending as well as clearer priorities for the project selection. in this regard the current debate about conditionalities for the next cohesion policy framework will help to agree on common approaches about incentive mechanisms.  all member states and regions should have in place the appropriate conditions for investments the cohesion policy to be effective. better targeting, monitoring and evaluating is a strategy that benefits all, as it has been observed in many policy fields and countries in the oecd. the effort made by the european commission to improve the statistical base, which is also a key asset of the oecd, must also be continued and extended towards the measurement of societal progress beyond gdp.ladies and gentlemen, we are looking for a new growth model, in the eu and elsewhere, based on innovation and green growth, inter alia. such a growth model needs to harness all endogeneous growth assets, most of them being regionally-based. regional policy is thus crucial to unleash the growth potential of our economies. this is the reason why it is so important to update, upgrade and strengthen the eu cohesion policy to make it more efficient. the oecd stands ready to continue to help you in this strategic endeavour. thank you!

1039@Global insurance market trends@http://www.oecd.org/finance/globalinsurancemarkettrends.htm@17/02/2023 - after a slowdown in 2020, the insurance industry experienced renewed premium growth in 2021, especially in the life sector. while claims payments returned to levels close to those prior to the covid-19 in some products, others continued to be affected by the lingering effects of the pandemic. the insurance industry is a major component of the economy by virtue of the amount of premiums it collects, the scale of its investment and, more fundamentally, the essential social and economic role it plays by covering personal and business risks. this annual report monitors global insurance market trends to support a better understanding of the overall performance and health of the insurance industry. the report is compiled using data from the oecd global insurance statistics (gis) database. the geographical reach of the gis database is constantly expanding and now covers 61 jurisdictions. in addition to the 38 oecd countries, it covers a number of non-oecd latin american countries – achieved through cooperation with the association of latin american insurance supervisors (assal) – and selected non-oecd jurisdictions in the asian region and elsewhere. this monitoring report and its associated database represent a rich source of comparable, global cross-country data on insurance markets. they provide a comprehensive source of information that can be used by governmental authorities (regulators, finance ministries, and central banks), the insurance sector, research community, and consumers, to monitor and analyse the insurance sector.  oecd insurance statistics publication
1040@OECD presents revised Codes on capital flows to G20@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-presents-revised-codes-on-capital-flows-to-g20.htm@08/06/2019 - cross-border capital flows are an integral component of international finance, but require a balanced framework for removing unnecessary barriers to the movement of capital while providing governments flexibility to cope with instances of economic or financial instability, oecd secretary-general angel gurria said today.the recently revised oecd code of liberalisation of capital movements remains the sole multilateral agreement among states dedicated to openness, transparency and mutual accountability in cross-border capital flow management, mr gurria said during a press briefing with japanese finance minister taro aso in the margins of the meeting of g20 finance ministers and central bank governors, taking place june 8-9 in fukuoka, japan.“ten years after the global financial crisis, all adherents to the code have agreed that an enhanced and modern multilateral framework for managing capital flows is needed, and have taken action to make the code stronger, giving it better governance, transparency, and decision-making capacity,” mr gurria said.the oecd code of liberalisation of capital movements (the code) was born with the oecd in 1961, at a time when many oecd countries were in the process of economic recovery and development and when the international movement of capital faced many barriers. it provides the world’s only multilateral agreement covering the full range of cross-border capital flows, and is binding for the 36 oecd countries, including eleven g20 members. the code has been open to non-oecd members since 2012.the code is based on several key premises:• an open multilateral regime for international capital flows serves the global economy better than closed capital accounts, particularly as financial markets play an increasing role in allocating cross-border saving and investment efficiently in support of a sustainable global recovery.• an adhering country should benefit from the liberalisation measures of other adhering countries regardless of its own degree of openness.• reintroducing capital flow restrictions can play a role in specific circumstances, but transparency, accountability and proportionality are critical. the updated code presented by mr gurria and minister aso better adapts the framework to current requirements of capital flow management, for both advanced and emerging economies alike. the revised code provides countries with the flexibility needed to respond to financial stability concerns, linked to large capital inflows and outflows, without diluting the code’s high standards of openness.“in a financially ever more integrated world with increased capital flow spillovers, the code provides a solid platform for multilateral debate, cooperation and consensus-making, discouraging countries from pursuing ‘beggar-thy-neighbour policies,’ mr gurria said. “fifteen of the g20 members are either adherent or in the process of adherence to the code, demonstrating its value as a tool for international cooperation on capital flow management in the g20 context.”looking ahead, the code will become increasingly relevant as major emerging economies open their capital accounts, mr gurria said. in latin america, argentina, brazil, colombia, costa rica and peru are following the path of their oecd neighbours chile and mexico in making credible commitments to progressive liberalisation as part of the process of adherence to the code.south africa is the first african country to have applied to the code and is making important progress in modernizing its framework for exchange controls. india and china are also gradually moving towards allowing greater capital mobility. “going forward, i hope and trust that a broader set of countries will be able to rely on the revised code as they continue opening their economies,” mr gurria said.the oecd and the japanese g20 presidency will co-host a high-level policy seminar on the codes on 11 september in paris. integration or fragmentation? international capital flows in the post-crisis world will bring together policy experts from all g20 countries for discussions on how the revised oecd codes can improve transparency, accountability, credibility and trust.for further information, contact winfrid blaschke (+33 1 4524 8367) in the oecd directorate for financial and enterprise affairs or lawrence speer in the oecd media office.working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
1041@Pension Markets in Focus@http://www.oecd.org/finance/pensionmarketsinfocus.htm@recent years have witnessed intense pension reform efforts in countries around the globe, often involving an increased use of funded pension programmes managed by the private sector. these funded arrangements are likely to play an increasingly important role in delivering retirement income in many countries and privately managed pension assets will play an increasing role in financial markets, notably as a source of long-term savings.pension markets in focus provides detailed and comparable statistics on retirement savings around the world. this annual statistical report contributes to the effort of making data on retirement savings available, as the oecd core principles of private pension regulation advocates for, to enable regulators and stakeholders to evaluate the design and operation of pension systems relative to their goals. these statistics can support policy discussions through international comparisons and peer learning, and are the basis of policy recommendations in the oecd series of pension reviews. these statistics can also be helpful to private sector representatives, journalists, academics and anyone interested in funded pension systems.
1042@OECD Sovereign Borrowing Outlook@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecdsovereignborrowingoutlook.htm@• the gross borrowings of oecd governments, which jumped by 70% in 2020 following the outbreak of covid‑19, are expected to gradually stabilise as economies recover and pandemic-related fiscal support is withdrawn. aggregate government market borrowing needs are projected to decline slightly from above usd 16 trillion in 2020 to around usd 14 trillion in 2022, with marked differences across countries.• oecd government net marketable debt issuance is expected to decline from usd 8 trillion in 2020 to around usd 3 trillion in 2021. it is projected to remain at around the same level in 2022, which is double pre‑pandemic levels.• since 2019, the outstanding level of marketable debt for oecd governments increased by more than usd 10 trillion to usd 50 trillion in 2021, and is projected to reach usd 53 trillion in 2022. as a percentage of gdp, central government marketable debt for the oecd area rose by more than 16 percentage points to 90% in 2020, and is expected to gradually decline to 88% in 2022, driven inter alia by stabilised borrowing needs and low interest payments. these estimations for 2022, made before the war in ukraine, are now subject to the economic effects of the war, as well as the monetary and fiscal policy responses.• the cost of borrowing has risen, but remains at low levels across oecd countries. in the oecd area, nearly 70% of the fixed-rate government bonds issued in 2021 were for a yield less than 1%. this ratio was 80% in 2020 and 37% in 2019.• many countries sought to mitigate refinancing risk by lengthening issuance maturities. the average term-to-maturity of outstanding debt has almost fully returned to a pre‑pandemic level standing at 7.6 years in 2021 and reached record highs in 16 oecd countries including france, italy, portugal, spain and the united states.• despite the extended maturities of new issuance, debt redemption profiles are expected to be elevated and may pose significant challenges in terms of refinancing risks, with 40% of outstanding marketable debt stock needing to be refinanced or repaid within the next three years.• given the refinancing needs, rising yields, inflationary pressures and the prospects of less accommodative monetary policy, it is important for sovereign debt managers to strengthen investor relations and remain transparent and predictable in providing guidance to investors. they may also explore new borrowing instruments to support financing capacity.• going forward, downside risks to the outlook include the potential emergence of new covid‑19 variants, persistent inflation and mounting geopolitical tensions. to ensure the continued smooth functioning of government securities markets, debt managers should remain vigilant, closely monitor the resilience of market intermediaries and co‑ordinate with the relevant authorities to promptly address possible stressed market conditions. authorities may benefit from tools such as security lending facilities, flexibility in their approach to issuance and maintaining contingency buffers to be able to absorb possible stress in markets.

1050@Risks rising in corporate debt market@http://www.oecd.org/finance/risks-rising-in-corporate-debt-market.htm@25/02/2019 - global outstanding debt in the form of corporate bonds issued by non-financial companies has hit record levels, reaching almost usd 13 trillion at the end of 2018. this is double the amount outstanding in real terms before the 2008 financial crisis, according to a new oecd paper.corporate bond markets in a time of unconventional monetary policy says that non-financial companies have dramatically increased their borrowing in the form of corporate bonds. between 2008-2018, global corporate bond issuance averaged usd 1.7 trillion per year, compared to an annual average of usd 864 billion during the years leading up to the crisis.companies from advanced economies, which hold 79% of the total global outstanding amount as of 2018, have seen their corporate bond volume grow by 70%, from usd 5.97 trillion in 2008 to usd 10.17 trillion in 2018.the corporate bond market in emerging markets, mainly driven by growth in china, reached a total outstanding amount of usd 2.78 trillion in 2018, up 395% compared to a decade ago. china has moved from a negligible level of issuance prior to the 2008 crisis to a record issuance amount of usd 590 billion in 2016, ranking second highest in the world.the risks and vulnerabilities in the corporate debt market are also significantly different from that of the previous pre-crisis cycle. the share of lowest quality investment grade bonds stands at 54%, a historical high, and there has been a marked decrease in bondholder rights that could amplify negative effects in the event of market stress. at the same time, in the case of a financial shock similar to 2008, usd 500 billion worth of corporate bonds would migrate to the non-investment grade market within a year, forcing sales that are hard to absorb by non-investment grade investors.against this background, the paper cites concerns around global economic growth. in the case of a downturn, highly leveraged companies would face difficulties in servicing their debt, which in turn, through lower investment and higher default rates, could amplify the effects of a downturn. while major central banks have modified their use of extraordinary measures recently, the future direction of monetary policy will continue to affect the dynamics on corporate bond markets. gross borrowings by governments from the bond markets are also set to reach a new record level in 2019, according to the recent oecd sovereign borrowing outlook 2019.any developments in these areas will come at a time when non-financial companies in the next three years will have to pay back or refinance about usd 4 trillion worth of corporate bonds, close to the total balance sheet of the us federal reserve.for further information, journalists can contact mats isaksson, head of corporate governance and corporate finance, (tel. + 33 1 45 24 76 20) or serdar celik, senior economist, (tel. + 33 1 45 24 79 84) in the oecd’s directorate for financial and enterprise affairs.working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
1051@Corporate Bond Markets in a Time of Unconventional Monetary Policy@http://www.oecd.org/finance/corporate-bond-markets-in-a-time-of-unconventional-monetary-policy.htm@25 february 2019 - corporate bond markets have become an increasingly important source of financing for non-financial companies since the global financial crisis. the total outstanding debt in the form of corporate bonds reached usd 13 trillion as of end-2018. in real terms, this is twice as much as in 2008. built on a dataset of almost 85 000 unique corporate bond issues by non-financial companies from 114 countries between 2000 and 2018, this paper documents a number of elevated risks and vulnerabilities associated with this development and looks at how the quality of today’s outstanding stock of corporate bonds differs from earlier credit cycles. bond ratings, bondholder rights and repayment requirements are areas of particular focus.
1052@State-owned firms behind China’s corporate debt@https://doi.org/10.1787/7c66570e-en@while china’s overall debt-to-gdp ratio is not particularly high, its non-financial corporate debt relative to gdp is higher than in other major economies. state-owned enterprises account for over three quarters of that debt with a size exceeding gdp. this paper provides insights into the size of debt, leverage and debt service burden by various non-financial soe groupings including by size, extent of state ownership, level of the owner, broad and detailed sector and region. although the debt stock of local soes increased the fastest, firms under government agencies leveraged up more quickly and their debt service burden also grew most rapidly. soes in services industries increased their debt fastest, in particular in social services, transportation, real estate and construction. in turn, warehousing and real estate firms have the highest leverage. firms in the three provinces of xinjiang, shanxi and qinghai rank among the top five in all the three indicators of debt to revenues, leverage and debt service burden. large soes owe most debt and leveraged up, while small and medium-size ones reduced their leverage. the surge in the debt service burden of small soes coincided with an increase in state assets in this group of firms. sector-wise, state assets increased most in competitive industries. empirical analysis shows that higher leverage and labour productivity are more conducive to a surge in soe debt. such surges appear to be triggered by falling interest costs, pointing to the role for easy monetary conditions in the rapid soe debt accumulation. recent corporate governance reforms of soes will likely act as disciplining device on soe borrowing.

1057@OECD, UN Environment and World Bank call for a radical shift in financing for a low-carbon, climate-resilient future@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-un-environment-and-world-bank-call-for-a-radical-shift-in-financing-for-a-low-carbon-climate-resilient-future.htm@28/11/2018 - the oecd, un environment and world bank group today called on leaders of g20 countries to do more to enable a radical shift of investment into low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure as a way to limit the impact of climate change.delivering a new report, financing climate futures: rethinking infrastructure, to the g20 at its summit in buenos aires, the three international organisations said governments need to adopt a more transformative agenda on low-carbon, climate-resilient investments if they are to meet the paris agreement goal of cutting co emissions to net zero in the second half of the century and build resilience to climate change.financing climate futures responds to an invitation from the 2017 g20 hamburg climate and energy action plan to the three organisations to document public and private activities for making financial flows consistent with the paris goals. it follows the 2017 oecd report investing in climate, investing in growth, an input to the g20 german presidency which laid out the economic case that climate action and growth can go hand in hand provided that strong climate policies are packaged with fiscal and structural reforms. the financing climate futures initiative aims to help countries move beyond an incremental approach to financing low-emission, resilient infrastructure towards the transformational agenda needed for decisive climate action. the initiative is supported by the federal ministry for the environment, nature conservation and nuclear safety of germany. “investing in low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure is vital for the future of the planet, and it can also drive economic growth,” said gabriela ramos, oecd chief of staff and g20 sherpa. “the infrastructure challenge creates incentives for reforms that can deliver better performance on both counts. we are losing time though – if we want to deliver we need to move much faster and achieve a systemic shift of trillions of dollars in green investment.”noting that energy, transport, buildings and water infrastructure contribute over 60% of greenhouse gas emissions, the report lays out six ways to bring public and private financial flows in line with the paris goals, in particular in infrastructure finance. these include better planning and foresight, integrating climate concerns into all budgetary decisions and leveraging public procurement into low-emission, resilient infrastructure.• plan sustainable and resilient infrastructure for a low-emission and resilient future• unleash innovation to accelerate the transition to low-emissions technologies, business models and services• reset the financial system in line with long-term climate risks and opportunitiesthe report says that scaling-up public and private investments in low-emission and sustainable infrastructure is critical to increase resilience and avoid further carbon lock-in.oecd analysis in investing in climate, investing in growth showed that shifting infrastructure investment into low-carbon options, combined with structural reforms, could increase global gdp by as much as 5% by 2050, while cutting emissions. that includes the effects of lower risks of damage from extreme weather events. the cost of shifting from brown to green infrastructure would be more than offset by fuel savings. according to the oecd, governments spend half a trillion dollars a year subsidising oil, coal or gas and are not making enough use of public spending as a lever to decarbonise economies by investing in low-emissions infrastructure and innovation. power plants under construction or in planning will lead to a near doubling of emissions from power generation, while incentives to shift to green energy and infrastructure, and disincentives to emit in all sectors, remain weak.“we cannot ignore the new reality of powerful weather events that threaten jobs, homes, food security and other critical areas of our lives,” said kristalina georgieva, chief executive officer of the world bank. “the infrastructure that is built today must be ready to cope with tomorrow’s changing climate. we need the right incentives and regulations to urgently accelerate funding to these projects.”change is happening, but too slowlythe final report of the un environment inquiry into the design of a sustainable financial system, released in april, found that progress on reforming the global financial system over the last four years has started to deliver financing for sustainability and set up the next wave of action. sustainability is becoming part of routine practice within financial institutions and regulatory bodies, green bond issuance grew from us$11 billion in 2013 to us$155 billion in 2017, and the number and range of policy measures to advance sustainable finance increased from 139 in 2013 to 300 by 2017.however, much more needs to be done, particularly in infrastructure.“with only 12 years to head off the worst impacts of climate change, we need rapid reform of our economies and societies, including a switch to low-carbon infrastructure,” said joyce msuya, acting executive director of un environment. “the g20’s economic power and political influence will be crucial to unlocking the investment we need to make this switch.”working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.un environment is the leading global voice on the environment. it provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and

1068@Financial system risk is elevated and global standards are essential in managing cross-border infrastructure investment@http://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-system-risk-is-elevated-and-global-standards-are-essential-in-managing-cross-border-infrastructure-investment.htm@03/09/2018 - a new oecd report, the 2018 business and finance outlook, highlights a number of major risks having the potential to disrupt global economic growth. it notes that the gradual normalisation of monetary policy in an environment of growing debt will be a major test of whether the basel iii regulatory reforms have achieved their goal of ensuring safety and soundness in the financial system.although capital rules have been strengthened, the business models of systemically important banks have changed little since before the crisis of 2008, says the report. one gauge of interdependence, the notional value of over-the-counter derivatives, was usd 532 trillion in the second half of 2017, only slightly below its pre-crisis peak of usd 586 trillion in late 2007.the report says the financial outlook will also be shaped by china’s ability to manage risks relating to high indebtedness and leverage in its banking, shadow banking and wealth management industries. the extent of non-performing loans in china is obscured by the lack of information about which assets are sitting in off-balance sheet vehicles. these could disrupt growth beyond china if further changes to the structure of financial markets and institutions are not considered in major advanced and emerging economies, according to the report.the risks to financial stability in china arising from elevated corporate indebtedness make it all the more important to ensure that china’s belt and road initiative (bri) results in economically viable projects. the outlook recognises the important contribution that the bri can make to filling the global infrastructure gap, but emphasises that all international infrastructure efforts should be mutually reinforcing and respect global standards. the report highlights that cross-border investment projects must be viable, cost effective and appropriately selected, regardless of the source of funding.the outlook argues that the bri will need to engage with other investing economies and institutions given its largely debt-funded nature and coverage of many countries with challenging business environments, and it says that significant contributions from oecd countries will be critical in the bri’s success. this will require an increasing role for markets in resource allocation decisions. property rights, competition, level playing fields and sound governance will need to be strengthened to make this possible.five areas that could benefit cross-border infrastructure investments from greater alignment with international standards stand out:• the growing role of state-owned enterprises (soes) in the global economy calls for ways to ensure a level playing field that discourages subsidies and non-transparent processes and allows recipient countries to benefit from investments based on widely accepted practices of corporate governance.• open and transparent arrangements for procurement, especially for large infrastructure investments, are needed.• the heavy costs that bribery and corruption can impose must be avoided, both in the case of large infrastructure projects and elsewhere. social and environmental costs need to be taken into account by ensuring responsible business conduct that minimises disruption to local communities.• governments need to conduct environmental impact assessments prior to implementing proposed projects for facilities and infrastructure.• open and transparent regimes for cross-border investment are needed to reduce costs and increase options regarding technology.in all five areas, oecd provides essential guidance for both the economies where the new infrastructure projects would be located, as well as for those countries where the financing, equipment and expertise may originate, notes the report.the oecd business and finance outlook 2018 is available at http://www.oecd.org/investment/oecd-business-and-finance-outlook-26172577.htm.for comment or more information, journalists should contact the oecd media office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
1069@The Global Forces Shaping Finance - Keynote address by Greg Medcraft@http://www.oecd.org/finance/global-forces-shaping-finance-keynote-greg-medcraft-2018.htm@keynote address by greg medcraft, director, financial and enterprise affairs, oecd(as prepared for delivery)your majesty, ladies and gentlemenwe are living in a time of accelerating technological change. long-established business models are being challenged and disrupted. new ideas and ways of doing things flow freely across borders and industries. few industries are being impacted more than finance – as we have seen with the proliferation of novel fintech offerings, the rise of challenger banks and the establishment of entirely new types of assets and payment systems. finance is also extremely personal. it touches virtually everybody’s lives. so while these developments are happening globally, they are experienced by consumers locally. the focus of today’s conference, global perspectives, local insights, could not be more fitting.i am going to offer my perspectives as the head of the oecd’s directorate of financial and enterprise affairs, which covers financial and capital markets, insurance and pensions and competition policy, among others.i will focus today on what i see as the 3 main forces driving change in the financial sector:• the accelerating digitalisation of the economy‌today’s conference comes roughly 10 years after the financial crisis. the crisis brought about a collapse in public trust in institutions, including in government and business, as shown in surveys such as the edelman trust barometer and in the oecd’s own research. trust has since improved, but it is still low and momentum has stalled over the past couple of years – particularly trust in business. edelman’s measures for trust in business in 2018 show that financial services have the worst results of any sector. just 54% of the general population trust financial service providers to ‘do the right thing’. this is alarming, but it is hardly surprising. boston consulting group estimates that banks paid usd $345 billion in fines between 2008 and 2017 – including usd $22 billion last year alone.and so far in 2018 we have seen more high profile breaches of trust in the financial sector, from fresh revelations of institutionalised misconduct at wells fargo to equifax’s failure to protect sensitive customer data.this matters for the financial system as a whole, because low trust threatens the confidence of investors and consumers in markets, which impacts financial flows and financial stability. it also matters for individual financial service providers because, more and more, trust is at the centre of long term sustainability and business success.this is supported by empirical analysis from the oecd. a study in last year’s oecd business and financial outlook found that a business’s social score – its capacity to generate trust and loyalty in its workforce, customers and society – was an overwhelming predictor of strong returns on equity and return on assets.this comes down to the power of the crowd – a business’s community of customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. the crowd sets the conditions of the social license to operate – the expectations of behaviour that a business must model in its operations. the crowd will hold business to account based on these expectations, and its power to do so is amplified through social media and the 24-hour news cycle. if a business falls short, it risks being deserted by its customers, employees and investors to its great disadvantage.in the context of low trust in the financial sector, consumers are not only open to alternative ways of banking and finance, they actually demand it. this has paved the way for the entry of large platforms like amazon and ali baba into financial services, and allowed fintech start-ups to seize on some of banking’s most profitable areas of business. and it underlies the sentiment of initiatives like the vollgeld campaign in switzerland, where voters went to the polls about three weeks ago to decide whether to strip banks of their deposits and end fractional reserve banking. while this initiative was defeated in the polls, it attracted around 24 per cent of the vote – that’s a nearly a quarter of swiss voters who want to bring a revolution to banking and banks’ role in the economy.‌the digital transformation of the economy has been happening for decades, but it is accelerating.in finance, this has spurred innovation, given rise to new business models and brought about efficiencies and better services. it has also meant disruption and a host of new market and regulatory issues.i see 5 major technological shifts that are having a significant impact the financial sector:• almost universal access to mobile telephones and internet• the development of blockchain and distributed ledger technologyi will now unpack each of these briefly.1. the almost universal access to mobile telephones and internet has a multiplier effect on economic and financial digitalisation.mobile internet penetration averaged above 100% in oecd countries for the first time in february this year, and continues to climb steadily in emerging markets. this brings better access to services and opportunities for all. it allows financial service providers to bring products to people who may have been under served previously.m-pesa is one excellent example of this, and i look forward to hearing about the regulatory experience in kenya in this afternoon’s keynote.2. big data and predictive analytics, including ai, are making it possible to tailor value offerings to customers in a cost effective way and make more informed decisions in business around things like risk modelling and pricing in insurance and lending‌but we also need to ensure that our existing regulatory frameworks – which are largely based on human systems and behaviours – remain fit for purpose.for the financial sector, the oecd has looked at the regulatory principles of ‘robo-advice’ for pensions, such as consumer protection and financial literacy. from a competition standpoint, we also remain aware of the possibility that algorithms could be used to achieve and sustain collusion without any formal agreement or even human interaction. and we are looking to establish an observatory on artificial intelligence to help governments stay abreast of the wider policy issues and developments in ai.3. blockchain and distributed ledger technology represent one of the most disruptive and promising emerging technologies for financial servicesmany of you will have some familiarity with blockchain so i will skip the specifics of the technology. the important thing to know is that through blockchain we can create networks that foster 3 things:blockchain and distributed ledgers hold huge potential for reducing intermediaries, boosting efficiency and reducing costs. their use is already driving a new generation of financial products. i could give many examples, but to name just five:many of these innovations are in their early stages, but together they illustrate just how disruptive blockchain could be to finance. blockchain is essentially taking us towards a future where the cost of transactions will be zero.4. rising cyber-security risks are increasingly weighing on our economies with the accelerating digitalisation of finance – the economic costs of cyber-crime worldwide were estimated at usd 1 trillion in 2017at the oecd, we see great potential for the insurance market to contribute to better cyber risk management. we’ve spearheaded a project on cyber risk insurance, to better understand and overcome challenges impeding the development of the cyber insurance market, with a particular focus on:5. growing data privacy concerns are posing an issue for businesses and governments everywhereconsumers have legitimate concerns about how personal data is collected, stored, shared and used.this is true for many emerging financial products, such as credit scoring using personal data, which was discussed in the academic conference here yesterday. the answers to these questions will largely determine trust in, and adoption of, digital technologies. and actually, i see blockchain as a part of the answer to some of these big cyber security and privacy questions.global markets have never been so interconnected. the kinds of new financial products and ideas that i’ve just described develop fast and spread quickly across jurisdictions. this has increased the complexity in which businesses operate, and created new cross-border issues that regulators need to manage. recent experience with initial coin offerings, or icos, illustrates these points. icos have raised around usd 14 billion to date, most in the past 12 months. their potential for raising capital for start-ups and established tech-firms alike is clear. however, they also suffer from 4 issues that give rise to legitimate market integrity and investor trust concerns:• they often escape regulatory oversight, which means a lack a formal regulatory market structure – for example around governance of issuance, trading and exchange - and a lack of minimum standards for investor disclosure, both before and after issuance.• they often raise issues of traceability in relation to anti-money laundering and know your customer requirements.• their tax status is largely undefined, owing to the often shifting nature of the asset – for example they can change from an asset token to a utility token which extends to unclear financial accounting approaches.• there are no global industry standards to support investor confidence.the response from regulators around the world has been extremely fragmented, and has ranged from banning them outright, to applying existing regulation on a case-by-case basis, to setting up wide-ranging legislative frameworks to govern ico markets. industry and investors lack the kind of certainty needed to fully realise the potential of icos, while the regulatory and legal void makes criminal activity difficult to detect and counter. when it comes to financial innovation, policymakers need to work together internationally more than ever, in order to achieve 4 things:• raise awareness of the potential risks but also benefits.the role of the oecdas you can see on this slide, the oecd is well placed to lead international co-operation efforts on these kinds of issues because we do 3 things:• we provide a forum for exchange between policymakers and stakeholders• we are an international policy standard setter• we provide capacity building and assist governments in policy development.‌and when it comes to the emerging policy issues presented by icos, cryptocurrencies and other digital financial assets, this is what we are doing.• as a forum for exchange - we convened a substantial meeting of regulators, industry, central banks and other stakeholders in may to identify the main issues presented by digital financial assets – with over 200 people from 60 countries. importantly, we also brought together other standard setting bodies like the imf, financial stability board and iosco. joining the dots on international efforts in this space is crucial. and next thursday we are holding a follow-up roundtable to delve deeper into the issues from the workshop, and identify actions and approaches government can take.• as an international policy standard setter - the oecd already holds a number of global instruments and guidelines to help manage the increasing complexity and fast pace of change, such as the g20/oecd principles of corporate governance and the g20 high-level principles of financial consumer protection. and we are looking to leverage our recent discussions to develop a set of guiding principles on the regulation and treatment of digital financial assets.• on capacity building - governments are actively seeking to build their capabilities in understanding to better respond to emerging financial products. our members and partners overwhelmingly want to strike a good balance between innovation and traditional regulatory concerns. we stand ready to help any government looking to implement our instruments or access our expertise.we are living in an exciting time for alternative finance. trust in the financial institutions is low, which is pushing consumers towards innovative new products and platforms – but these new services also need to ensure they meet customer expectations if they are to be sustainable. digitalisation and new technologies are allowing new financial service offerings to be developed which we could scarcely imagine just a few years ago. globalised markets are increasing the complexity of the regulatory environment. it is critical that governments work together to maintain a regulatory level playing field and provide legal certainty.more than ever, policy makers, researchers and industry need to approach developments in financial markets with global perspectives. they also need to and leverage and share their own local insights. today’s conference is an excellent opportunity to do just that.
1070@Low productivity jobs driving employment growth in many OECD countries@http://www.oecd.org/finance/low-productivity-jobs-driving-employment-growth-in-many-oecd-countries.htm@26/06/2018 - weak labour productivity growth continues to mark the world’s advanced economies and risks compromising improvements in living standards, says a new oecd report.in its latest compendium of productivity indicators, the oecd says that the slowdown in labour productivity growth (measured as gross value added per hour worked) has especially affected manufacturing – both high tech activities such as computers and electronics, as well as industries requiring lower skill levels – and that gaps in labour productivity levels between large and smaller firms remain high.and although economic growth in many countries has led to rising employment, particularly in italy, mexico, spain, the united kingdom and the us, the majority of new jobs are in activities with relatively low productivity.the greater number of low productivity jobs has also weighed down on average wages across the economy as a whole. real wages (adjusted for inflation) fell between 2010 and 2016 in portugal, spain and the united kingdom. although in some countries, such as germany and the us, real wages have begun to rise in line with, albeit still slow, labour productivity growth in recent years, in many sectors wages continued to lag labour productivity growth. this was the case in one third of all sectors in germany and the us.“the long-term decoupling in wage and productivity growth we see in many oecd countries may also be driving inequalities in income and wealth,” the oecd’s chief statistician martine durand said. “slowing productivity growth and the large number of low productivity jobs being created both limit the scope for improvements in material well-being.”the share of income from economic activity going to labour through wages has declined in most countries in recent years, but most markedly in hungary, ireland, israel, mexico, poland and portugal.the compendium shows that by 2016, the latest year for which comparable international data is available, investment, an important driver of productivity growth, was beginning to pick up. however, investment rates, particularly on machinery and equipment and other tangible assets, were still below pre-crisis levels in many oecd countries.investment in intellectual property products, such as software and r&d, has been increasing since before the crisis, often at a faster pace than investment in physical capital but significant differences remain across countries. the share of total investment going to intellectual property in 2016 ranged from 1.1% in colombia to 30% in switzerland and 56% in ireland.the compendium says the relatively robust investment in intellectual property, where the benefits to business may take time to feed through, may act as a catalyst for stronger economic growth in the future.the oecd says productivity is ultimately a question of “working smarter” rather than “working harder”. this reflects firms’ ability to produce more output by better combining inputs through new ideas, technological innovations, as well as by way of process and organisational innovations.the compendium, available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pdtvy-2018-en, provides comparative data up to 2016 on all aspects of productivity for each oecd country, including long term trends.for further information, journalists are invited to contact the oecd media office (tel: +33 1 4524 9700).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
1071@Financial Management of Earthquake Risk@http://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-management-of-earthquake-risk.htm@earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural perils and can lead to severe economic, social and environmental impacts. rapid urbanisation, the accumulation of assets in seismic areas – and, to some extent, increasing induced seismicity – have led to an increasing amount of exposure to earthquake risk in many parts of the world. the financial management of earthquake risk is a key challenge for individuals, businesses and governments in developed and developing countries, and the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors and apec finance ministers have recognised the importance of building financial resilience against these risks.this report applies the lessons from the oecd’s analysis of disaster risk financing practices and the guidance in the oecd recommendation on disaster risk financing strategies to the specific case of earthquakes. it provides an overview of the approaches that economies facing various levels of earthquake risk and economic development have taken to managing the financial impacts of earthquakes.financial instruments for managing risks related to climate change
1072@Women in economics: The unknown cost of gender imbalance@http://www.oecd.org/finance/women-in-economics-the-unknown-cost-of-gender-imbalance-2018.htm@this event will focus on some of the issues emerging from the gender biases evident in the field of economics. emmanuelle auriol, professor at toulouse school of economics and chair of women in economics of the european economic association mathilde mesnard, deputy director, oecd directorate for financial and enterprise affairs academic economists are overwhelmingly male. in europe, only 20% of senior economists are women while, in the united states, only 15% of full professors are women. and only one woman has ever been awarded the nobel prize in economics (elinor ostrom in 2009). putting aside issues of misogyny, sexism and the glass ceiling - issues that are prevalent in other fields whether academic or not - the gender imbalance in economics does have systemic repercussions on the quality of data produced and the sub-fields of economics emphasized by researchers, and used by governments, to develop policies that have day to day impacts on the life of citizens. reaching as far back as the 1950s, dr. gary becker hypothesized that the lack of women economists, and their promotion to senior positions, suggested an inefficiency, discouraging the most productive and most talented economists from advancing and thus ultimately undermining quality. further research states that women and men may approach economics differently, with the latter emphasizing formalism rather than human dynamics. a 2013 survey of american economists, for example, found that men in the field were more sceptical of regulation and high minimum wages and less likely to favour redistribution than women. women economists tend to be found in more humanistic sub-topics such as health, education, development and labour. if systemic gender bias skews the way economics examines issues, there are serious implications for the governments and public policy.

1091@Gender gaps in financial literacy and financial education@http://bit.ly/2xYVfz9@gender inequalities persist in all areas of social and economic life and across countries. young women in oecd countries generally obtain more years of schooling than young men, but women are less likely than men to engage in paid work. gaps widen with age, as motherhood typically has marked negative effects on gender pay gaps and career advancement. women are also less likely to be entrepreneurs, and are underrepresented in private and public leadership positions.the 2013 and 2015 oecd gender recommendations provide guidance on how to advance gender equality in education, employment, entrepreneurship and public life; this book discusses recent developments in these areas in one overview chapter and 24 short chapters which each include key findings and policy recommendations. topics include violence against women, gender budgeting, the unequal sharing of unpaid work, labour market outcomes and migration. the book presents a range of indicators illustrating gender gaps. it also discusses recent policy initiatives, such as pay transparency measures to reduce gender wage gaps and policy reform aimed at fathers taking parental leave. overall, progress has been slow and there is a strong need for further policy action to close gender gaps in education, employment, entrepreneurship and public life.

1093@Financial Education for MSMEs and Potential Entrepreneurs@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/bb2cd70c-en@micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (msmes) make up the majority of enterprises in the world, providing employment and contributing significantly to national incomes. many msmes face a number of challenges, including regulatory hurdles and tax burdens, difficulties accessing finance and a lack of general guidance or support. financial education can be an important tool for helping msmes and potential entrepreneurs to obtain access to finance and strengthen money management skills.this working paper presents the results of a stocktake of 21 economies. it shows that, while some msmes have access to education, training or mentoring, in most economies approaches are fragmented and risk missing important groups. identifying msmes as a target group within national strategies for financial education would contribute to addressing some of the challenges they face. this would also underline the importance of measuring levels of financial literacy among msmes and help policy makers and stakeholders to evaluate programmes that target this group.
1094@Coping with the financial consequences of devastating floods@http://www.oecd.org/finance/coping-with-the-financial-consequences-of-devastating-floods.htm@"‌07/09/2017 - hurricane harvey’s floods have had a devastating impact on houston and other parts of the united states. with hurricane irma, the biggest ever atlantic storm, wreaking havoc across the caribbean, august and september 2017 are likely to be remembered as one of the most significant periods of flood devastation in recent years. from the flooding-related mudslide that killed more than a 1,000 people in sierra leone, to monsoon-related flooding that has ravaged india, bangladesh and nepal, to the ""1-in-500 year"" storm that has devastated one of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states - few periods of time have so obviously illustrated the significant potential of floods to disrupt people’s lives.flooding is one of the most common, wide-reaching and destructive natural perils, affecting on average about 250 million people around the world each year according to the un office for disaster risk reduction. the continued accumulation of people and assets in floodplains and along coasts, the changes to land-use that accompany population growth and the expected impact of climate change on the intensity of storm and precipitation events all point to an increasing risk of ever more devastating floods in the future. while still early to predict, some estimates suggest that the financial cost of hurricane harvey will exceed the usd 68 billion in overall losses caused by hurricane sandy in 2012 and potentially even the usd 125 billion in overall losses that resulted from hurricane katrina in 2005, the second costliest natural catastrophe event in the world since at least 1980, if not ever. unfortunately, the vast majority of these losses will be borne by households and small businesses - and ultimately taxpayers - given the low level of insurance coverage for flood damages and losses in the united states. no country can claim to have implemented the optimal approach to managing this complex policy challenge. oecd work on the financial management of flood risk has identified a number of ways that policy makers can improve the management of the financial implications of floods, including:• greater investment into - and use of - flood maps and models to understand the potential impacts of flooding and the effectiveness of protective investments, both for events that have occurred and those that may occur in the context of a changing climate.• better targeting of government regulation, investment and financial assistance towards reducing the level of risk, particularly in communities where the level of exposure makes insurance unviable.• enhancing the contribution of (re)insurance and capital markets to managing the financial impacts of flood events and encouraging risk reduction.• improved coordination in using the range of policy tools that are available for managing flood risk and encouraging risk reduction across all levels of government and segments of society. catastrophic flood events such as those witnessed in the past weeks reinforce the need for more effective management of the financial impacts of flood events. there are few more promising opportunities to drive positive change than the aftermath of a catastrophic event."
1095@Open and Orderly Capital Movements: Interventions from the 2016 OECD High-Level Seminar@http://www.oecd.org/finance/open-and-orderly-capital-movements-2017.htm@this collection compiles the contributions of senior policy experts, academics, and economic practitioners on developments in the financial integration and financial regulation of cross-border capital flows since the 2008 global financial crisis at the oecd high-level seminar “open and orderly capital movements” held in october 2016. the long-term move towards capital account openness among large emerging markets, the role of macroprudential measures in minimising systemic risk associated with large capital flow volatility, the avenues of reconciling individual country regulatory objectives and the collective interest of open and deep capital markets are discussed. the contributions also consider how the oecd code of liberalisation of capital movements may be further developed into an inclusive multilateral framework to support a resilient and open global financial system and ultimately robust investment and growth. an open, transparent and orderly international system of capital flows underpins growth and stability. in an increasingly interconnected world economy, faced with episodes of heightened capital flow volatility, significant value is attached to a credible commitment mechanism that is sensitive both to the need to keep investment flowing but also to ensure financial stability concerns are addressed. a rule-based, co-operative framework for capital flow policies can help countries maintain market confidence and continue to attract the capital needed to support inclusive growth and sustainable development. the oecd code of liberalisation of capital movements provides such a framework. as an instrument that encourages co-operation, it has provided a tried and tested process for global dialogue for over 50 years. currently adhered to by all thirty-five oecd countries (including twelve g20 countries), and open to adherence by non-oecd countries, the oecd code is the sole multilateral agreement among state parties dedicated to openness and transparency in cross-border capital flow policies. while there is no presumption that full liberalisation is an appropriate goal for all countries at all times, the oecd code is based on the premise that long-term business investment and growth potential cannot be achieved with closed capital accounts and that “beggar-thy-neighbour” approaches to capital flow policies can result in negative collective outcomes.

[read full transcript]stronger business and consumer confidence, rising industrial production and recovering employment and trade flows will all contribute to an improvement in global gdp growth from 3.0% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2018, according to the outlook.among the major advanced economies, the recovery will continue in the united states, which is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018. the euro area will see steady growth at 1.8% in 2017 and 2018. in japan, growth is projected at 1.4% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. the 35-country oecd area is projected to grow by 2.1% in both 2017 and 2018, according to the outlook.in china, growth is expected to slow to 6.6% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018, while india’s growth rates are expected to strengthen to 7.3% this year and 7.7% in 2018. growth in brazil is expected to turn positive for 2017 before reaching 1.6% in 2018.while the outlook welcomes the pick-up in the global economy, it points out that the forecasts still leave growth rates below both past norms, as well as the pace needed to escape fully from the low-growth trap. it also draws attention to the fact that while some factors could push global growth higher than projected, there are also significant downside risks.on the positive side, the outlook points to the ageing capital stock of firms that may spur stronger-than-expected replacement investment in higher quality capital with more advanced technology. this would improve cyclical conditions and support a revival of investment-intensive global value chains, with knock-on benefits to domestic demand. higher quality capital would also improve productivity and boost potential output.among downside risks, the outlook points to financial risks and vulnerabilities in advanced and emerging economies, high policy uncertainty in many countries and continued weak wage growth.“policymakers cannot be complacent” said oecd chief economist catherine l mann. ”better choices on fiscal, structural and international policies will improve the well-being of a country’s own citizens, but also spill over to improve the outcome for others, raising the probability that the current cyclical upturn will endure and become the foundation for sustained and broad-based improvements in living standards around the world.”a special chapter in the outlook shows that deeper trade integration through global value chains has increased productivity and raised well-being. but it has also led to job losses, particularly for some manufacturing workers, accentuating pressures from technological and demand changes. with manufacturing activities regionally concentrated, this has resulted in some regions falling behind.the outlook suggests that an integrated approach is needed to make globalisation work for all. this must include domestic policies to encourage opportunity, innovation and the creation of new firms, so as to yield economic growth that is both stronger than in the recent past and also more inclusive. at the same time, more effective targeted policies are needed to support people and regions that risk getting left behind. last but not least, countries must work together to fill gaps in the governance of the international economy. this will ensure a more level playing field, as well as more robust and implementable international standards across a range of areas including labour markets, the environment, corporate responsibility, governance and taxation. for more information on the global economic outlook, see: www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm read the full version online: www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-outlook-volume-2017-issue-1_eco_outlook-v2017-1-enjournalists are invited to contact the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).
1099@The empirics of enabling investment and innovation in renewable energy@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/67d221b8-en@this working paper undertakes econometric analysis to assess the impacts of climate mitigation policies and the quality of the investment environment on investment and innovation in renewable power in oecd and g20 countries. it also assesses how countries’ investment environments interact with climate mitigation policies to influence investment and patent activity in renewable power. the paper gathered and tested data across oecd and g20 countries on more than 70 explanatory variables, which were analysed using two poisson-family regression models: one to investigate determinants of investment flows in renewable power from 2000 until 2014; and one to investigate determinants of patent counts in renewable-power technologies from 2000 until 2012. results of the econometric analysis are consistent with the main hypothesis in this paper that beyond setting climate mitigation policies, policy makers need to strengthen the general investment environment and align it with climate mitigation policies in order to mobilise investment and innovation in renewable power across oecd and g20 countries.
1100@Increased international co-operation on financial and corporate issues essential to making globalisation work for all@http://www.oecd.org/finance/increased-international-co-operation-on-financial-and-corporate-issues-essential-to-making-globalisation-work-for-all.htm@30/05/2017 - globalisation has failed to create a level playing field in trade, investment and corporate behaviour, being one of the factors contributing to a backlash against openness in many countries and a decline in confidence in government institutions. only by stepping up international co-operation and improving and ensuring global markets, companies and institutions play according to the same rule book can productivity growth be restored, excess capacity avoided and public confidence improved, according to a new oecd report.the oecd business and finance outlook 2017 says that strengthening global governance and co-operation on corporate and financial issues involves establishing “rules of the game” which are both fair and perceived by all to be fair.the report argues that countries participating in globalised markets need to commit to a common set of transparent principles that are consistent with mutually beneficial competition, trade and international investment. this would reduce the problems left to be dealt with by domestic policy. it would also help improve resource allocation through promoting productivity growth and reducing the extraction of rents that harm consumers.“the backlash against globalisation has grown in many countries and too little has been done to help more people cope with the inter-related impact of trade, foreign direct investment and technological change,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “in addition to developing more effective domestic policies, it has become essential for all nations to work together to ensure a level playing field in trade, investment and corporate behaviour to better address the downsides of globalisation while preserving the benefits of economic openness. this will ensure that the growth it fosters is inclusive and sustainable, and that globalisation works for all.”greater fairness in cross-border interactions reinforces policies to help workers affected by globalisation and technological change. these should include: increased infrastructure investment, structural reforms, safety nets, worker retraining and education, and kick-start adjustment support for trade-exposed workers.the report also addresses other areas where action is needed to level the playing field. these include:• the impact of state-owned enterprises: these companies grew from 9.8% of the fortune global 500, to close to 23% in recent years. importantly, they include large financial companies which can play a key role in funding other soes on favourable terms across most business sectors. in light of this growing importance in the global scene, it is critical that soes governance and ownership respect best practices and prevent government support or subsidies that distort competition.• collusion through cross-border cartels is raising prices for consumers and in particular low-income families: two hundred and forty cartels were detected and fined between 1990 and 2015, affecting usd 7.5 trillion in sales. countries need to enforce rules around bid rigging and reduce barriers to collecting information and sharing investigations between authorities in different countries.• stricter enforcement of bribery and corruption laws is needed to improve the face of globalisation in the world economy. rent-seeking behaviour is estimated to be 2% to 3% of world gdp, equivalent to the size of the french economy. the report reveals that strong bribery laws consistent with the oecd anti-bribery convention cause adhering countries to invest less in corrupt regimes and more in countries with sound property rights and accountability.• competition in equity finance markets needs to be strengthened. the outlook says that in the case of ipos of less than usd 100 million, the average cost is 9 to 11% of the transaction. this increases the cost of equity and works against long-term productive investment.international organisations like the oecd have an important role to play in developing these rules, says the report. more needs to be done to broaden adherence to standards such as the anti-bribery convention, the g20/oecd principles of corporate governance and the oecd guidelines of multinational enterprises. governments also need to step up their implementation and enforcement to level the globalised playing field.the report is available at http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-business-and-finance-outlook-2017-9789264274891-en.htmthe business and finance outlook will be complemented by two other oecd reports looking at different aspects of globalisation in the coming weeks: the economic outlook (7 june) and the employment outlook (13 june).for more information, journalists should contact the oecd media office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).
1101@Can better international co-operation help build a fairer global economy?@http://www.oecd.org/finance/can-better-international-cooperation-help-build-a-fairer-global-economy.htm@30/05/2017 - the first concern of all citizens is to try to ensure that the environment they live in is the best that it can be. today the debate rages about whether the decline in living standards is due to the effects of globalisation or simply to poor domestic policy. both have played a role, but even if all countries implemented sound domestic policies, there would still be major losers in a world without a level economic playing field. the size and cost of the policies needed to protect the losers would be burdensome and possibly beyond reach.with respect to globalisation, the basic problem is that not all countries are “open” to the same extent and the economic playing field is not level. this year’s oecd business and finance outlook discusses many aspects of the lopsided nature of the world economy: capital account and exchange rate management; uneven financial regulations; the growing role of state-owned enterprises (soes); cross-border cartels which ensure that the benefits of globalisation accrue to companies and their shareholders instead of to consumers via lower prices; collusive behaviour in investment bank underwriting practices; cutting corners in responsible business conduct; and the bribery and corruption which distorts international investment and misallocates resources.so what does the data from thousands of companies presented in the 2017 oecd business and finance outlook show us about how uneven global competition is contributing to the backlash against globalisation?spectacular developments in trade and international investment - since entering wto in 2001, china has quickly become the largest exporting nation in the world, with 14% of merchandise exports and 18% of manufacturing. hong kong (china), singapore and korea together export as much as the united states or germany (see figure). instead of exporting from home, companies can also set up production abroad closer to foreign markets. china is now responsible for 11% of world m&a outflows in 2016 while inward m&a has declined to a low of 2% of the global total.why state-owned enterprises may be a cause for concern - there is nothing wrong with success in cross border activities—provided of course that success is not based on unfair competition. soes don’t fit the model of managers acting on behalf of diverse shareholders. they are agents of the state and an important part of its industrial strategy. emerging-economy soes are not limited to natural monopolies such as utilities. indeed, listed companies have heavy state ownership across all sectors— averaging 23% of their market capitalisation. this excludes the vast unlisted soe sectors. in china, the average market cap of state-held shares is over 40% of the total.these soes have become a force to be reckoned with. the number of soes amongst the fortune global 500 companies grew from 9.8% in 2005 to 22.8% in 2014. the largest of these are chinese banks that play an important role in funding state-owned firms in all industries, subsidising the cost of capital and facilitating state-driven industrial strategies. emerging market soes have greatly contributed to the current excess capacity in key materials, energy and industrial sectors. this is contributing to a decline in the average return on equity in many sectors and countries.‌ capital account and exchange rate management - the level of the playing field is also affected by capital account and exchange rate management of emerging economies. advanced economies generally have overvalued real exchange rates—even after allowing for a country’s level of economic development (see figure). some large emerging economies also price to market to ensure they obtain and maintain large global market shares. this requires variable mark-up in pricing, particularly when exchange rates are permitted to move.not all advanced economy companies are sitting still - penetration of markets by emerging economies evokes responses from companies to move further up the value chain and the leaps in productive potential can be enormous. companies that innovate well in their own industry quickly find that they run out of room at home. if they don’t take advantage of global economies of scale they will find themselves facing strong competition from other successful firms at home. the fastest productivity growth companies are also those that take advantage of foreign sales—whether by exporting or by setting up subsidiaries that produce abroad to serve foreign markets. it does not matter where firms sit in the value chain. maquiladoras are just as likely to face global competition as any advanced-economy company, forcing them too to restructure and enhance technology to remain competitive.trade versus technology - all of this requires investment, innovation and new technology. the company data shows that it makes no sense to try to separate these things out: to argue that “it’s not trade, it’s the robots” that are hollowing out the middle classes. the companies at the forefront of innovation and technology (as reflected in productivity growth) are often multinationals engaged in trade and foreign direct investment—they buy and sell business segments, set up to produce abroad and the export from multiple global production bases. and yes, they have the resources to invest in r&d or to buy the start-ups that fit with their strategies as they fight it out in the global market place.painful wage convergence and the hollowing out effect - the losers in this story (those workers affected by reduced hours, innovative work contracts and compressed remuneration) belong to companies that are scattered within their own industry (it’s not workers of one industry versus those of another). it is not the middle class as such that is being hollowed out—rather, these ranks are swelled by those that work for middle-paying companies that are forced to restructure or exit. wages in incumbent “once were great” firms are being compressed painfully towards the leaner global adapters as their productivity falls.towards greater fairness - some large emerging economies have managed to pull millions of people out of poverty—and the long-term future of every country lies with continued success in this regard. competition too is to be welcomed. like any sporting match, let the best teams win. but also like any sporting match, the game needs to be played with the same rulebook. if the same rules do not apply to all, then fairness is put into question. if fairness is questioned, then sustainability of open trade and investment in the global economy is also put at risk.the 2017 oecd business and finance outlook tries to look at a number of the elements of what a level playing field might look like. it offers instruments and guidelines that could be used to improve the rules of the game and enhance international co-operation. this requires a commitment by economies participating in globalised markets to a common set of transparent principles that are consistent with mutually-beneficial competition, trade and international investment across a range of areas.

1105@Business brief: Insuring well-being in a changing world@http://www.oecd.org/finance/business-brief-insuring-well-being-in-a-changing-world.htm@insurance is invisible yet it is everywhere. it is intimately linked to how people live their lives, grow their businesses, save and invest their incomes, anticipate what is essential to them and how they protect themselves against risk. when lifestyle and economic growth patterns change, insurance also needs to change: autonomous cars raise new questions of liability, freelance workers need new social protection, and new expectations require personalised assistance services, seamless claim processes and the like. the insurance industry sits at the heart of the social, economic and technological revolutions at play. and like most of its peers, axa is undertaking an ambitious and profound transformation to adapt and embrace these multiple revolutions, reframing the nature and scope of our business, from financial protection to risk prevention, from paper to digital, from payment of claims to more frequent interactions with customers. we are also reviewing our ecosystem of providers and business partners. this transformation is not only about us; it is about the innovation we will be able to bring to our sector by building on our own convictions and promoting new ideas, investing in new business models, partnering with start-ups and funding fundamental and applied research. our ambition cannot happen in a vacuum however, since it raises a number of societal questions and challenges. how can we best address customer expectations towards private companies?in many industries, innovation is currently driven by digitalisation and personalisation of services. while the content, ease-of-use and nature of service offerings improve, companies and policymakers have to work hand in hand to guarantee the protection of customers’ rights and of their privacy in a digital world, and make sure that a sound competition can take place while ensuring that prices remain fair. striking such a balance with customer protection and transparency will be key to maintain the essential trust between private companies and customers. how can we ensure both stable and flexible regulation? the speed of development and adoption of new technologies seem at odds with the stability of traditional regulatory frameworks. we must avoid the trap of regulatory frenzy–i.e. constantly changing our regulations for each new technology coming to market. new, flexible methods of action, based on a set of clear and overarching principles and expected outcomes–such as encouraging experiments of innovative regulatory schemes around fintech–can allow innovation to blossom while also guaranteeing customer protection, financial stability and co-building between regulators and innovators. how can we harness the ability of technology to foster more inclusive protection models? big data, algorithms and artificial intelligence are all very promising tools to empower citizens, better respond to their needs in real time, and scale services to new customer segments. while mobile technologies are empowering millions of families in developing countries to gain access to health insurance and prevention, if not properly handled and understood, these new tools could turn into a source of undue discrimination, social fragmentation and exclusion. transparency, fairness and constructive dialogue surrounding these new tools should form a common horizon between policymakers and companies to ensure the promotion of more inclusive societies. how can we balance our collective relationship to time?technology gives a new sense of precipitation to the world economy, from high-frequency trading in financial markets to robotisation and 3d printing in manufacturing sectors. in parallel, long-term challenges linked to climate change, ageing and the protection of natural resources call our economic system into question. the time horizons of corporate and financial decisions force us into a conundrum in which short-term pressures curb the long-term thinking necessary to address new and intricate challenges. the role of policymakers is therefore essential, as they can set the pace of the public debate and keep our focus on essential long-term challenges, to help our societies invest for future generations. as insurers, we are fully aware that change always comes with new opportunities and risks requiring new levers of action. managing and balancing the risks and opportunities that arise from technologies and new growth patterns is probably the greatest collective endeavour of our time. all actors will need to engage and share their perspectives–policymakers, corporations, citizens. as insurers, we feel compelled to take part in this essential debate.

1110@OECD Recommendation on Disaster Risk Financing Strategies@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-recommendation-disaster-risk-financing-strategies.htm@23/2/2017 - the effective financial management of disaster risks is a key public policy challenge for governments around the world, particularly those faced with significant exposures to such risks and/or limited capacity to manage the financial impacts of natural and/or man-made disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, terrorist attacks, industrial and technological accidents, and pandemics. with these considerations in mind, the oecd has adopted a recommendation on disaster risk financing strategies that provides guidance on the development of strategies for the financial management of disaster risks. the recommendation provides a set of high-level recommendations for designing a strategy for addressing the financial impacts of disasters on individuals, businesses and sub-national levels of governments, as well as the implication for public finances. it specifically targets issues related to the financial management of disaster risks, while recognising the importance of an integrated approach to disaster risk management and the contribution of risk assessment, risk awareness and risk prevention to the financial management of disaster risks, drawing on the lessons that have been learned through the oecd’s work for the g20 and apec finance ministers. in that regard, it complements the oecd recommendation on the governance of critical risks, providing and integrated set of oecd guidance on disaster risk management and financing. this recommendation replaces the 2010 recommendation on good practices for mitigating and financing catastrophic risks. more information on the oecd work on disaster risk financing is available here.
1111@The role of public debt managers in contingent liability management@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/93469058-en@contingent liabilities are major sources of fiscal risks due to the uncertain financial commitments they involve. their effective management, therefore, is essential for increasing stability and predictability in public finance. this paper explores the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management based on the results of a background oecd survey and the information provided by seven task force countries. the results indicate that there are certain roles and responsibilities assumed by the public debt managers in this field, while the degree of involvement differs widely across countries. we also observed that the debt management offices’ (dmos) involvement is more prominent in the management of government credit guarantees, while contingent liabilities arising from public private partnerships (ppps) and government sponsored insurance programmes appear to be outside the domain of public debt managers in most cases. drawing on leading country practices and lessons from the past, this paper advises public debt managers on possible motives and areas of involvement.
1112@OECD Insurance Statistics@http://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-markets/oecdinsurancestatistics.htm@the insurance industry is a key component of the economy by virtue of the amount of premiums it collects, the scale of its investment and, more fundamentally, the essential social and economic role it plays by covering personal and business risks. since 1982, the oecd has collected and analysed data on various insurance statistics, as well as discussing relevant methodologies. data are collected from official bodies in oecd countries on the number of insurance companies and employees, insurance premiums and investments by insurance companies. the scope of data collection also extends to gross claims payments, gross operating expenses and commissions. the data are available from 1983 onwards and are broken down under numerous sub-headings. more recently, key balance sheet and income statement items were also added to the oecd’s statistical framework for insurance.
1113@Design of funded private pensions needs to be improved@http://www.oecd.org/finance/design-of-funded-private-pensions-needs-to-be-improved.htm@5/12/2016 - pension systems are changing in response to the challenges they face. funded pension arrangements, in particular defined contribution ones, are playing a growing role in complementing retirement income from public sources in oecd countries and worldwide. however, their design needs to be improved, according to a new oecd report.the 2016 oecd pensions outlook analyses how the pensions landscape is changing in the face of challenges that include ageing populations, the fallout from the financial and economic crisis, and the current environment of low economic growth and low returns. the report shows that there were 13 oecd countries in which assets in funded pensions represented more than 50% of gdp in 2015, up from 10 in the early 2000s. over the same period, the number of oecd countries where assets in funded private pension arrangements represent more than 100% of gdp increased from 4 to 7 countries.the increased role of funded pension arrangements mostly comes from defined contributions (dc), pension arrangements in which there is a direct link between contributions, assets accumulated and pension benefits. however, the oecd warns that, although these arrangements have important advantages, they put more of the risks of saving for retirement (e.g. investment and longevity risk) and decision making in the hands of individuals.”defined contribution pensions offer some advantages in the current environment of ageing populations, low growth and low interest rates but, as individuals bear more risk and responsibility for managing their retirement finances, we certainly need to focus on improving their design,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría, launching the report in paris (read full speech).• in most oecd countries, the tax treatment of retirement savings provides an overall tax advantage for individuals over their life cycle, but the size of the advantage varies. in at least 20 oecd countries, tax benefits for retirement savings (in relative terms) increase with income. using flat-rate subsidies and matching contributions can help target assistance towards lower-income individuals and prevent a further widening of inequalities upon retirement.• a coherent framework for retirement is needed to accommodate and encourage the use of annuity products as they can play an important role in helping individuals mitigate investment and longevity risks. however, increased product complexity heightens the need for appropriate financial advice and comprehensible product disclosures to ensure that consumers purchase products suitable for their needs. it also underlines the need for the regulatory framework to adapt to innovations in product design and encourage appropriate risk management for annuity products.• policy makers need to ensure that consumers receive appropriate financial advice for retirement. measures need to be put in place to ensure that the conflicts of interest that advisors face are mitigated and that advisors are adequately qualified. however, attention also needs to be paid to ensure the continued accessibility and affordability of advice, an area in which technology-based advice can potentially play a role.• low financial literacy poses serious challenges, as individuals are increasingly responsible for managing their own retirement wealth. financial education for retirement planning should be implemented, whilst information about pensions should be available, clear and not overwhelming for individuals; where possible it should be standardised (e.g. costs, fund performance). all information for individuals’ pension plans should be combined and available to use with calculators/simulators in order to provide greater insight.• in the four oecd countries with separate civil service pension schemes, civil servants’ future pension promises measured in terms of replacement rates are 20 percentage points higher for a full career than those of the private sector. the oecd recommends a pension framework that applies the same rules to the public and private sectors; this should facilitate labour mobility and increase efficiency.for more information on the oecd pensions outlook 2016, please visit: www.oecd.org/pensions/oecd-pensions-outlook-23137649.htm.journalists are invited to contact the oecd's media division (tel: +33 1 4524 97 00).working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

1119@OECD/INFE International Survey of Adult Financial Literacy Competencies@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-infe-survey-adult-financial-literacy-competencies.htm@news release: oecd financial literacy study finds many adults struggle with money matters assessing the levels of financial literacy in the population is a key component of a successful national strategy for financial education, enabling policy makers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses. international comparisons increase the value of such an assessment by allowing countries to benchmark themselves with other countries. where similar patterns are identified across countries, national authorities can work together to find common methods for improving financial literacy within their respective populations. addressing a call by g20 leaders to develop practical tools for financial literacy measurement, the oecd/infe has conducted an international data collection exercise to measure financial literacy and financial inclusion. a total of 51,650 adults aged 18 to 79 from 30 countries and economies participated in the survey. the survey results were released at the global symposium on financial education in auckland, new zealand, on 12 october 2016.
1120@OECD financial literacy study finds many adults struggle with money matters@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-financial-literacy-study-finds-many-adults-struggle-with-money-matters.htm@12/10/2016 – adults in many countries around the world display low levels of financial knowledge, fail to engage in financial behaviours that could improve their financial security and have financial attitudes oriented towards the short-term, as shown in the oecd/infe international survey of adult financial literacy competencies released today. some 30 countries and economies, drawn from africa, asia, europe, australasia, north america and south america, have collected data for this study measuring their levels of financial knowledge, behaviours and attitudes. in total, 51,650 adults aged 18 to 79 have been interviewed for this study. the large number of countries and economies opting to participate in the survey indicates the widespread recognition of the value of undertaking an international comparative study and the growing interest in developing evidence-based financial education policies, in accordance with oecd/infe high-level principles on national strategies for financial education, endorsed by g20 leaders in 2012. overall levels of financial literacy - indicated by combining scores on knowledge, attitudes and behaviour - are relatively low. the average score across all participating countries and economies is just 13.2 (out of a possible 21), and 13.7 across oecd countries. average levels of financial knowledge show room for improvement, whilst there is wide variation between countries. on average, just 56% of adults across participating countries and economies achieved a score of at least five out of seven (63% across oecd countries), considered to be the minimum target score. over four out of every five (84%) adults in hong kong, china were able to answer at least five out of seven knowledge questions correctly. however, in stark contrast, fewer than one in two adults achieved this minimum target score on financial knowledge in albania, belarus, brazil, the british virgin islands, croatia, jordan, malaysia, the russian federation, south africa, thailand and the united kingdom. low levels of understanding of the accumulation of interest on savings and of diversification are a particular concern. even in the highest scoring countries, at least one in five respondents could not calculate the balance of an account after 2% interest had been added. and, with the exception of adults in hong kong, china (52%), the netherlands (56%) and norway (58%), only a minority was also able to correctly identify the impact of compounding on such interest payments over time. no more than half of respondents understood the financial concept of diversification in the russian federation, thailand, malaysia and the british virgin islands. gender differences in financial knowledge are noteworthy. in 19 of the 30 participating countries and economies, men are statistically significantly more likely than women to achieve the minimum target score on the financial knowledge questions. the survey also reveals considerable variation in the extent to which people behave in financially literate ways. across participating countries and economies, on average just one in two (51%) respondents achieved the minimum target score of at least six out of nine on financial behavior. the average across participating oecd countries is only slightly higher, at 54%. the weakest areas of financial behaviour across these measures appear to be related to budgeting, planning ahead, choosing products and using independent advice. on average, across participating countries and economies, only 60% of adults reported having a household budget (57% across the oecd); and only about 50% set long-term goals and tried to achieve them (51% across the oecd). among those who had chosen a financial product in the last two years, only 44% made an attempt to shop around on average across all participating countries and economies (46% across oecd countries), and only 19% used independent information (20% across oecd countries). in a similar vein, analysis of financial attitudes also shows that many people have a tendency towards short-termism. on average, just 50% of adults across participating countries and economies achieved the minimum target score for financial attitude (that is, one that shows a tendency to favour the longer term), compared with an average of 55% across oecd countries. in jordan, hong kong, china and poland, fewer than three in ten people indicated an attitude that tends to favour the longer term. in contrast, in albania, hungary, portugal, canada, norway and new zealand, more than six in ten did so. these high-level findings make it possible to draw a first set of policy conclusions. the overall low level of financial literacy stresses the importance of starting financial education early and, ideally, in schools. moreover, public authorities need to improve financial resilience and long-term planning, support smart choice of financial products, and more generally strengthen knowledge, skills and behaviours of adults, through effective financial education, in combination with appropriate financial regulation, inclusion and consumer protection policies. findings from this new publication were presented at the nz-oecd high-level global symposium on financial education in auckland today by flore-anne messy, head of the financial affairs division of the directorate of financial and enterprise affairs at the oecd. download the oecd/infe international survey of adult financial literacy competencies for more information on the measurement and findings.
1121@OECD to help put innovation at heart of G20 global growth strategy@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-to-help-put-innovation-at-heart-of-g20-global-growth-strategy.htm@"5/9/2016 - leaders of the g20 countries meeting at their summit in hangzhou, china, have called on the oecd to help develop an agenda to build a stronger, more innovative and inclusive world economy.the leaders endorsed a series of action plans to implement their growth strategies covering a broad swathe of policy areas – from innovation and skills to entrepreneurship and investment finance; from improving productivity and trade to tackling money laundering, combatting tax avoidance and reducing overcapacity in the steel sector. a central focus of china’s g20 presidency has been the need to identify new driving forces for economic growth. the oecd has contributed ideas, analysis and data in support of the presidency's goal to integrate an innovation action plan which aims to support investment in science and technology, improve skills and encourage the exchange of knowledge.in their communique, the leaders welcomed the work by the oecd and other international organisations on the measurement of the digital economy and committed to expand broadband access and investment in the information, communications and technology (ict) sector. they also urged countries to seize the opportunities of the so-called new industrial revolution, particularly those offered by new technology in manufacturing. they agreed to strengthen cooperation and research and to support workers most affected by technological change.oecd secretary-general angel gurría said: “china is to be congratulated for placing innovation at the heart of their g20 presidency. it is important to not just repair the problems of the past but to lay the foundations for future growth – growth that will to a large extent be driven by new ideas and technologies.”the urgent need to harness new sources of economic dynamism was underlined to summit leaders by mr gurría. the global economy remains stuck in a low-growth trap, he said. eight years after the start of the crisis unemployment and inequality remain high. growth in wages and productivity is weak while trade and investment is low. despite a 2014 g20 commitment – monitored by the oecd and imf – to raise global gdp by an additional 2% by 2018, measures implemented so far will only add around 1%.“we are only halfway there,” said mr gurría. calling for full implementation of the g20 countries’ growth commitments, he added: “structural reforms to promote product market competition, skills upgrading, labour mobility, and financial market robustness are critical to create an environment conducive to the innovation needed to kick-start productivity and bolster long-term, inclusive growth.”to counter a rising risk of protectionism, the g20 leaders said they would endeavour to build an open world economy by strengthening trade and investment cooperation. oecd’s contributions in this area have included helping to draw up guiding principles for investment policy-making and providing analysis to support government efforts to reduce unnecessary trade costs, open services markets, and prioritise trade facilitation measures. investment is the lagging engine of the world economy, and the g20 underscored its important role for a more dynamic global growth.the secretary-general told g20 leaders that effective implementation of reform was already bearing fruit in the areas of tax transparency and in tackling evasion and avoidance.so far 85 nations and jurisdictions – including many developing countries – have committed to implement and monitor the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project through a new g20/oecd inclusive framework. the beps project closes gaps that allow corporate profits to “disappear” or to be artificially shifted to low or no tax environments.meanwhile, 101 jurisdictions will automatically exchange financial account information by 2018. already countries have identified almost 55 billion euros in additional tax revenues thanks to voluntary disclosure and similar programmes. leaders asked the oecd to prepare a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions by their summit in 2017.on tax reform, as across all the action plans discussed by the leaders, robust implementation and coherence among participating countries will be crucial, as the challenges of an increased integrated global economy require continued cooperation.gabriela ramos, the oecd’s chief of staff and sherpa to the g20, said: “the oecd is proud to have been a strategic partner of the chinese g20 presidency across a range of policy areas. going forward, we will facilitate the new g20 task force on innovative growth, and provide a venue to discuss issues such as steel over-capacity.”she also emphasised oecd contributions on other important areas such as the role of skills and training, on investment in infrastructure, and support to small and medium-sized enterprises.the g20 action plan for sustainable development was given a boost on the eve of the summit when the us and china, the world’s two largest economies, announced they would formally ratify the paris climate change agreement. the two countries also released peer reviews of their fossil fuel subsidies – a move welcomed by the oecd, which had chaired the peer review process. the oecd also contributed analysis on green finance, including green bonds, institutional investors and investment governance.further

1123@Corporate governance of financial groups@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlv1m6zq3nx-en@companies today, in particular banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, increasingly operate their businesses in a group structure. these financial groups have a growing presence in markets worldwide and the economy as a whole. to do business effectively and efficiently in group structures, corporate groups should be managed in a holistic and integrated manner, in much the same way as an enterprise. good governance of corporate groups should not therefore be very different from that of a corporation with many departments and branches. nonetheless, the idiosyncratic risks that group structures bring about may require particular attention be paid to the governance of corporate groups. such risks include the complexity of group structures and responsibilities among member companies in a multi-layered ownership structure across borders. the legal status of subsidiary companies, which is different from departments or branches of a corporation, should be respected. the governance of corporate groups needs to address inherent issues such as the dilemma of subsidiary boards’ loyalty to the interests of the subsidiary versus the broader interests of the group, and the risks associated with related party transactions. in the case of financial groups, particular consideration should be given to the interests of depositors and insurance policyholders of each financial subsidiary. financial regulation increasingly establishes requirements for the governance responsibilities of the boards of financial subsidiaries, while emphasising the overall responsibility of the ultimate parents of financial groups.

1126@Fiscal incentives for R&D and innovation in a diverse world@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264257573-8-en@public policy has an important role to play in promoting research and development (r&d) and the development, diffusion, and use of new knowledge and innovations. fiscal incentives, including tax policies, should be directed at specific barriers, impediments or synergies to facilitate the desired level of investment in r&d and innovations. without careful design, policies can have unintended consequences such as favouring incumbent firms, encouraging small firms to undertake less efficient activities, or creating arbitrage and rent-seeking activity. r&d tax policy needs to be considered in the context of the country’s general tax policies, its broader innovation policy mix and its other r&d support policies. more r&d activity in one country does not necessarily result in an overall increase in global innovation if it is simply shifted from another country. more research is needed to determine the extent to which r&d fiscal incentives in one country increase overall r&d, the quality of that r&d, and its positive spillovers to other sectors of the economy and other countries.
1127@The Financial Markets Outlook@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264257573-6-en@the global economy is caught between two major headwinds: the reversal of the investment-heavy commodity supercycle; and the “l-shaped” recovery in advanced economies caused by the aftermath of the financial crisis and the interaction of re‐regulation with low and negative interest rates. the zero and even negative time value given to money is having perverse effects. investors are being herded into concentrated and less liquid positions which work against long-term value creation and productivity growth. normalisation of interest rates and a sustainable recovery of asset prices is shown to depend on which global scenario emerges: an “inflation first” set of policies favoured by central banks, and avoidance of a “creative destruction” phase to deal with over-investment and excess capacity in certain sectors and countries; or “productivity first” policies that bring about structural adjustment more quickly. the scenario most likely to emerge is one of continued monetary ease and choppy and sometimes volatile markets. equities are least overvalued but cannot rise sustainably on monetary policy alone. longer-run negative valuation adjustments are implied for some of the other most severely overvalued asset classes.

1136@Finance, amorality and double speak@http://www.oecd.org/finance/finance-amorality-double-speak.htm@when i was interviewing 200 bankers and banking staff working in europe's financial centre the city of london, perhaps the most telling was the language. not so much the profanities– though there were many of those–nor the technical stuff and three-letter acronyms (tlas). most striking were terms that seemed designed to sidestep any possibility of ethical discussion. when discussing their banks’ use of loopholes in the tax code to help corporations and rich people legally evade taxes, bankers used words such as “tax optimisation” or “tax-efficient structures”. financial lawyers and regulators who went along with whatever banks propose were “business-friendly”; cases of proven fraud or abuse became “mis-selling” and exploiting inconsistencies between two countries’ regulatory systems was 'regulatory arbitrage'. if you work for a big bank in the city, people explained, you do not ask if a proposal is right or wrong. you look at whether it is profitable and compliant, i.e. in accordance with the law. the banking talk is about “getting past” the legal department, past compliance, past risk, past internal and external auditors, and past the regulator. once these boxes have been ticked, there is nothing to stop you. and so the cliché of evil and immoral bankers does not hold up. banks have vast structures with tens of thousands of staff in internal control departments, such as compliance and internal audit. leaving the inevitable rotten apples and those caught up in the libor and foreign exchange scandals aside, most bankers seem anxious about not breaking the rules. instead, the question they ask is always: how, within those rules, can we game the system? before 2008 the bankers involved in the toxic products that were eventually to blow up did not wonder whether these products were good for clients, or the economy, or even for their banks–which could fire them in a jiffy anyway. rather, the bankers would enquire if what they were doing was legal and, if it was, there was no more discussion. for bankers “amorality” is the word. to them, it is fundamentally different from immoral. gordon gekko in the iconic film “wall street” deliberately breaks the rules, while in the “wolf of wall street” jordan belfort is continually flouting the law. gekko and belfort are immoral. amoral fibre: michael douglas as gordan gekko in “wall street”, and leonado di caprio as jordan belfort in “the wolf of wall street”. for an amoral decision, however, concepts like good and wicked simply do not enter the process. the question is whether something is forbidden or allowed and, if it is, the only remaining issue concerns reputation risk, and how it might look in the news. compartmentalisation is another word that bankers use: being upstanding and decent citizens at home is okay, but at work, hard selling lucrative financial products to “some guy at a small bank in sweden” who clearly doesn’t understand what he is buying is also not a problem. the biggest compliment in the city is to call someone professional. it means you do not let your emotions get in the way, let alone moral beliefs–those are definitely to be left at home. the word ethics comes up only in combination with work, referring to an almost absolute obedience to one’s boss. this is the mind-set created by an ideology of “shareholder value”; employees of a publicly listed corporation are taught and drilled into believing they have one task and one task only: to make as much money as possible for their shareholders–within the law. still, i pressed interviewees on the deeper moral dilemmas, about hiding behind laws that their bank's lobbyists helped write, for instance. that’s where the laws exist: after all, laws always have to catch up with technology, so initially there are no rules governing new financial products, which helps explain the deliberately complex and highly opaque variations of the collateralised debt obligations that nearly sank the world economy in 2008. in the final analysis, all the solemn promises of cultural change by top bankers in the aftermath of the lehman brothers’ crash are hard to take seriously. banks are still publicly listed and therefore conditioned with the mind-set of amorality. the crisis may have had citizens the world over clamouring for a new beginning, but most of my interviewees claimed that at their bank it was back to business as usual. luyendijk, joris (2015), swimming with sharks: my journey into the alarming world of the bankers, faber

1151@The transition in the Mexican pensions system to one based on individual defined contribution accounts has increased its financial sustainability@http://www.oecd.org/finance/the-transition-in-the-mexican-pensions-system-to-one-based-on-individual-defined-contribution-accounts-has-increased-its-financial-sustainability.htm@15/10/2015 - the reforms to the pensions system in mexico, especially the introduction of a system of individual defined contribution accounts, have significantly improved the system’s financial sustainability.these reforms cover private-sector workers insured by the mexican institute of social security (imss), federal government employees insured by the government workers’ social security and services institute (issste) and certain other government agencies.one challenge that remains is gradually to harmonise the rules for all pension plans, whether offered by the federal government, local government or universities, among other bodies, with the eventual aim of establishing a genuinely equivalent national pensions system for all mexicans, according to the new oecd review of the pensions system in mexico.at the end of 2014, the system’s pension-backing assets amounted to roughly 14.1% of gdp. in only 17 years, mexico ranked in the midrange of oecd countries. the oecd secretary-general angel gurría also noted during the launch of the report in mexico city that “institutionally, in line with common practice among oecd countries, consar has been quite correct in its regulation and supervision of the system, which has made it possible for the pensions system in mexico to be more efficient and become a tool that promotes inclusion and well-being.” (read the full speech of the secretary-general)nonetheless, challenges remain, and it is therefore necessary to continue to make improvements to ensure the survival of the system in the long term. in that regard, mr gurría commented that “the new system of defined contributions will be successful only if compulsory contributions are increased and a pro rata mechanism introduced to smooth the transition from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ defined contribution pension system.”given that current contributions to the system are low, considering that it must guarantee an income level of more than 50% of a worker’s last salary, it will be important for those contributions to rise.significant challenges also lie ahead in relation to protection for seniors. the poverty rate among seniors in mexico, who account for over 30% of the adult population, is the second-highest in the oecd, after korea. in order to overcome this, the review proposes increasing the level of old-age assistance and highlights the importance of improving integration between the level of assistance, in other words pensions for seniors, and the minimum guaranteed pension.the review also draws attention to the restrictiveness of the present investment system (based on specialised retirement fund investment companies known as siefores). currently, workers have very limited options in the multi-funds system. despite greater diversification, mexico’s pension funds are still concentrated too heavily in debt instruments compared to other oecd countries.the review states that more could be done to promote competition among private pension fund managers (afores). although the rates charged by afores in mexico have declined by more than 70 basis points over the past decade, they are still high by international comparison.download the full report in english (pdf). visit the dedicated page for oecd review of the pensions system in mexico.for more information, please contact carolina ziehl from the oecd mexico centre, tel. +52 55 91 38 62 35.working with over 100 countries, the oecd is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.

1153@OECD presents outputs of OECD/G20 BEPS Project for discussion at G20 Finance Ministers meeting@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-presents-outputs-of-oecd-g20-beps-project-for-discussion-at-g20-finance-ministers-meeting.htm@reforms to the international tax system for curbing avoidance by multinational enterprises‌ watch the webcast of the press conference 05/10/2015 - the oecd presented today the final package of measures for a comprehensive, coherent and co-ordinated reform of the international tax rules to be discussed by g20 finance ministers at their meeting on 8 october, in lima, peru. the oecd/g20 base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project provides governments with solutions for closing the gaps in existing international rules that allow corporate profits to « disappear » or be artificially shifted to low/no tax environments, where little or no economic activity takes place.revenue losses from beps are conservatively estimated at usd 100-240 billion annually, or anywhere from 4-10% of global corporate income tax (cit) revenues. given developing countries’ greater reliance on cit revenues as a percentage of tax revenue, the impact of beps on these countries is particularly significant.“base erosion and profit shifting affects all countries, not only economically, but also as a matter of trust,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “beps is depriving countries of precious resources to jump-start growth, tackle the effects of the global economic crisis and create more and better opportunities for all. but beyond this, beps has been also eroding the trust of citizens in the fairness of tax systems worldwide. the measures we are presenting today represent the most fundamental changes to international tax rules in almost a century: they will put an end to double non-taxation, facilitate a better alignment of taxation with economic activity and value creation, and when fully implemented, these measures will render beps-inspired tax planning structures ineffective,” mr gurría said.undertaken at the request of the g20 leaders, the work to address beps is based on the 2013 g20/oecd beps action plan, which identified 15 actions to put an end to international tax avoidance. the plan was structured around three fundamental pillars: introducing coherence in the domestic rules that affect cross-border activities; reinforcing substance requirements in the existing international standards, to ensure alignment of taxation with the location of economic activity and value creation; and improving transparency, as well as certainty for businesses and governments.the oecd will present the beps measures to g20 finance ministers during the meeting hosted by turkey’s deputy prime minister cevdet yilmaz on 8 october, in lima, peru.following delivery of the beps measures to g20 leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 november in antalya, turkey, the focus will shift to designing and putting in place an inclusive framework for monitoring beps and supporting implementation of the measures, with all interested countries and jurisdictions invited to participate on an equal footing.the final package of beps measures includes new minimum standards on: country-by-country reporting, which for the first time will give tax administrations a global picture of the operations of multinational enterprises; treaty shopping, to put an end to the use of conduit companies to channel investments; curbing harmful tax practices, in particular in the area of intellectual property and through automatic exchange of tax rulings; and effective mutual agreement procedures, to ensure that the fight against double non-taxation does not result in double taxation.the beps package also revises the guidance on the application of transfer pricing rules to prevent taxpayers from using so-called “cash box” entities to shelter profits in low or no-tax jurisdictions, and redefines the key concept of permanent establishment, to curb arrangements which avoid the creation of a taxable presence in a country by reliance on an outdated definition.the beps package offers governments a series of new measures to be implemented through domestic law changes, including strengthened rules on controlled foreign corporations, a common approach to limiting base erosion through interest deductibility and new rules to prevent hybrid mismatch arrangements from making profits disappear for tax purposes through the use of complex financial instruments.nearly 90 countries are working together on the development of a multilateral instrument capable of incorporating the tax treaty-related beps measures into the existing network of bilateral treaties. the instrument will be open for signature by all interested countries in 2016.the beps measures were agreed after a transparent and intensive two-year consultation process between oecd, g20 and developing countries and stakeholders from business, labour, academia and civil society organisations.“everyone has a stake in reversing base erosion and profit shifting,” mr gurria said. “the beps project has shown that all stakeholders can come together to bring about change. swift implementation by governments will ensure a more certain and more sustainable international tax environment for the benefit of all, not just a few.”for further information on the oecd/g20 base erosion and profit shifting project, including the 2015 explanatory statement, the 2015 beps reports, background information and faqs, go to: www.oecd.org/tax/beps-2015-final-reports.htmmedia queries should be directed to pascal saint-amans, director of the oecd centre for tax policy and administration, (+33 6 2630 4923) or the oecd media office (+33 1 4524 9700).

1158@Can pension funds and life insurance companies keep their promises?@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264234291-8-en@this chapter examines the potential impact of an environment of protracted low interest rates on pension systems and life insurance companies. it describes the mechanisms through which prolonged low interest rates can affect the solvency position of these institutions and uses available data to assess potential impacts.the outlook for the solvency position of pension funds and life insurance companies is of concern. insofar as their promises are linked to evolving parameters or can be adjusted to the new environment of low interest rates, low inflation and low growth, these institutions may be able to weather the situation. however, there is a very serious concern for the financial outlook should these institutions become heavily involved in an excessive ‘search for yield’ in order to fulfil any fixed guarantee promises they may have made when interest rates were higher. regulators and policy makers should remain vigilant.
1159@Low interest rates threaten solvency of pension funds and insurers@http://www.oecd.org/finance/low-interest-rates-threaten-solvency-of-pension-funds-and-insurers.htm@24/06/2015 - the current low interest rate environment poses a significant risk for the long-term financial viability of pension funds and insurance companies, as they seek to generate sufficient returns to meet promises, according to a new oecd report.the inaugural edition of the oecd business and finance outlook says the main concern is that pension funds and life insurance companies might become involved in the “search for yield” in order to match the levels of returns promised to policyholders and beneficiaries when interest rate were higher. this poses risks including insolvency. “generating the resources needed to confront the challenge of ageing populations will require a better global allocation of resources to the most productive investments but without excessive risk-taking,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría launching the report in paris (watch the live webcast). “above all, much remains to be done to strengthen the ability of the financial system to absorb shocks and avoid the bubbles and busts of recent decades” he added. (read the speech)the report also cites a very real risk that the current trend for companies to return cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, in order to boost short-term returns, means that capital will not be reinvested in more productive activities. this will hurt innovative investment and productivity growth. there are also risks building up from greater leverage and riskier investment in higher-yield and complex products with poor liquidity.over the next five years, pension funds are expected to grow 26% from an estimated usd 28.4 trillion in 2014 to usd 35.8 trillion in 2019; insurance companies’ assets will grow 33% from usd 28.2 trillion in 2014 to usd 37.7 trillion in 2019; and mutual funds will expand by 38% from usd 33.4 trillion in 2014 to usd 46.1 trillion in 2019.pension funds and insurers could face issues as high-yielding bonds are replaced by low-yielding bonds in their portfolios. lower interest rates will lead to lower returns for pension funds, which invest around 40% or more of their assets in fixed income securities, including lower yielding government bonds. if interest rates remain low into the future, funds and insurers may find their assets insufficient to meet their promises, unless they adjust their pension or payment promises.to reduce insolvency risks, insurers may need to offer lower guaranteed returns on new contracts to reduce liabilities and, in extreme cases, renegotiate current terms. pension plan sponsors could adjust or terminate existing plans and offer less attractive terms to new employees. defined benefit pension plan sponsors could increase contributions to funds. regulators and policy makers will need to remain vigilant to prevent excessive “search for yield”, says the report.the oecd business and finance outlook also analyses the rise of shadow banking and the impact of financial sector reforms since the crisis. it says there is still much to do to eliminate the current under-pricing of risk and to strengthen the ability of the system to absorb future shocks. these should involve ensuring strong capital bases and making key financial sector firms less interconnected by, for example, separating shadow banking from more traditional deposit banking and implementing policies to limit critical leverage.other chapters in the outlook address bank and capital market financing of smes; mnes in the shifting global business landscape; market-based financing of corporate investments; and pro-competitive policy reform for investment and growth.the oecd business and finance outlook has been launched during a high-level roundtable. for more information, please visit : www.oecd.org/daf/oecd-business-finance-outlook.htm.an embeddable version of the report is available, together with information about downloadable and print versions of the report.for more information, journalists should contact the oecd media division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).

1162@OECD Ministers launch new framework to boost sustainable investment@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecd-ministers-launch-new-framework-to-boost-sustainable-investment.htm@4/06/2015 - oecd ministers have endorsed updated guidelines to help national governments and regional groups create the right conditions to attract domestic and foreign investment.ministers agreed the updated policy framework for investment (pfi) – first developed in 2006 – during the oecd’s annual ministerial meeting in paris.the updated version places more focus on infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises and the role played by global value chains in economic activity. it also includes gender issues, a vital element of inclusive development, as well as policies to channel investment in areas that promote green growth.“the global investment landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “this updated framework will help get investment to where it is most needed, making it more effective and sustainable to benefit business, society and the environment.”the policy framework connects 12 policy areas: investment policy; investment promotion and facilitation; competition; trade; taxation; corporate governance; finance; infrastructure; developing human resources; policies to promote responsible business conduct and investment in support of green growth; and public governance.a taskforce, co-chaired by finland and myanmar, led the work on the update. more than 25 countries at varying levels of development and across all continents have already used or are currently using the pfi to assess their business climate and design reforms, ranging from botswana and burkina faso to cambodia, china, india, indonesia, morocco, myanmar, peru and zambia. this experience has informed the update. the pfi is ready for use as a global reference for investment policy reforms, including for development co-operation.the pfi also complements other areas of oecd work on investment and long-term financing, including the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises, the oecd principles of corporate governance and the g20/oecd high-level principles for long-term investment financing by institutional investors.ministers from the 34 oecd member countries were joined at the annual ministerial council meeting by ministers and representatives from brazil, china, colombia, costa rica, india, indonesia, latvia, lithuania and south africa, as well as by senior officials from various international organisations. ministers and high-level representatives from argentina; hong kong, china; kazakhstan; myanmar; morocco; peru; and senegal were also invited to participate in certain sessions of the ministerial.for more information on the policy framework for investment, see: www.oecd.org/investment/pfi.htmfor further information, journalists can also contact the oecd media division (+ 33 1 45 24 97 00).photos from the closing news conference and all the week’s events can be downloaded at https://www.flickr.com/photos/oecd
1163@China: Banking on a new international financial institution@http://www.oecd.org/finance/china-banking-new-international-financial-institution.htm@in october 2014 china launched the asian infrastructure investment bank (aiib), drawing wide international attention. nearly 60 countries have joined the new international financial institution, including several oecd member and partner countries, though others have remained cautiously outside. what is the purpose of the new bank and what impact will it have? we asked yide qiao for his views. i guess there are several reasons for launching the new bank. first, china has accumulated valuable experience and expertise in construction and investment in infrastructure over three successful decades of economic growth and is now willing to extend its knowledge to other developing countries in a systematic way. second, the chinese economy is entering a more mature phase in which capital outflows will become inevitable. by setting up new financial institutions, china is clearly keen to make this outflow happen as smoothly as possible. at the same time, it will better use its huge capacity, particularly in the area of infrastructure construction, and use the country’s near us$4 trillion of foreign reserves in diverse and useful ways. lastly, for well-known reasons, imf quota and governance reforms have not gone ahead, which has made developing countries unhappy, including china. therefore, it is natural for china to use its deep pockets to launch the new bank. the asian countries need a large amount of investment in infrastructure to overcome the existing gap in this area, while some advanced countries interested in providing their technologies have joined the aiib. the fact that some other advanced countries were rankled by their joining attracted even more attention. over the next few months, major talks begin on development finance, sustainable development goals, climate change. how does the new bank alter the global financial landscape? i don’t believe new institutions such as the aiib will completely alter the global financial landscape over the next few months, or even years. for a start, they are not very big in terms of capital and will take time to bed in after the establishment procedures are out of the way. not to mention the fact that new financial institutions need to climb steep learning curves. having said that, i believe they will acquire a meaningful role in improving the existing global financial architecture, to judge from their claims to be more effective, cleaner and greener. they will learn from and co-operate with the world bank, the asian development bank (adb) and so on, but they will not copy everything from them. how effective do you think the new bank will be? the aiib is the first international financial institution that gives china a leading role. as far as i am aware, the chinese officials organising it fully understand how important their responsibilities are and will make every effort to ensure that the aiib is successful. i have seen encouraging signals from traditional multilateral development banks. in october when the new bank was launched, the world bank group created the global infrastructure facility (gif)–a global open platform–that will facilitate the preparation and structuring of complex public-private partnerships to mobilise private sector and institutional investor capital, particularly for infrastructure. at a recent meeting in baku, the capital of azerbaijan, the adb announced it would blow the dust off an old development fund that was originally launched four decades ago by boosting its annual lending and grant approvals by 50%, to as much as us$20 billion. it will also set aside money to support public-private partnership projects and work with the aiib in asia. it will be very interesting to watch how these actions play out, and to monitor this co-operation among the development banks. if all goes well, the outcome will be beneficial not only to developing countries but to the international community as a whole. this is surely the fundamental goal of the aiib and other new international financial institutions, and all final judgements will be based on that. for more on the shanghai development research foundation, visit www.sdrf.org.cn/ oecd work on the people's republic of china
1164@Investment and inequality: Stock markets for whom?@http://www.oecd.org/finance/investment-inequality-stock-markets.htm@the world economy desperately needs more productive investment: to create jobs, to increase productivity and to meet critical global goals like combating climate change. but instead of more productive investment, we are getting rising stock markets. sadly too many policymakers and journalists don’t know the difference. let’s start off with the basic confusion. investment is when savings are used to pay for the creation of new productive assets–improvements in land, new buildings, machinery, computer software, the education of workers to create human capital. households, companies and governments can all make investments, but certain types of investments, in public goods like roads or carbon emission controls, are more likely to be made by government. buying stocks and bonds on the stock market–the secondary market–may be something people can do with their savings, but it’s not an investment in the sense economists understand the word. no new productive assets are created when a person buys a share of stock on the secondary market. so here is the paradox of post-crisis economic policy. everyone agrees we need more investment, but too many governments have pursued economic policies based on austerity. these policies have cut public investment directly, and then cut jobs, wages and economic growth, which drives investment in the private sector. in response first to the actual financial crisis and then to this fiscal madness, central banks in the us and europe have cut short-term interest rates to near zero. when that was not enough to keep consumer demand alive and to fend off deflation, the central bankers began to intervene in long-term bond markets, buying bonds to keep long-term rates low. low interest rates, weak economies, and effectively bankrupt major banks combined to ensure that even though interest rates were very low, credit did not flow to a damaged real economy, but rather into secondary capital markets. hence the paradox of low interest rates, low levels of investment and high stock prices. in advanced economies, corporate investment has declined by an average of 25% since the global financial crisis compared with pre-crisis forecasts, an imf report said. the punch line: with austerity policies came threats of deflation and recession. in response, central bankers sought to use monetary policy to counteract fiscal policy. without any policy measures to push credit toward the real economy, the predictable result was that the banks poured credit into wall street speculative secondary capital market asset purchases. from an inequality perspective, the results were terrible. in general, stocks and bonds are held by the more affluent, so the credit-fueled bidding war for secondary market assets added to the paper asset value of the wealthy, while doing nothing for most workers. in the us alone, shareholder returns reached more than us$903 billion in 2014, with $350 billion in dividends and $553 billion in buybacks. some have blamed central banks for keeping interest rates low. but that’s mistaken. central banks, starting with the us federal reserve board, rightly saw their economies heading toward recession and deflation and acted with the tools they had. as federal reserve chair ben bernanke noted at the beginning of quantitative easing, the people who should have acted were in the us congress; they should have moved to stimulate our economy and create jobs, rather than choke our economy with our particular brand of austerity, called the sequester. in europe, of course, the austerity programme has been far worse, and the european central bank compounded it by initially raising rates in the face of an economic slowdown. policymakers in oecd countries really need to be focused on growth strategies that combine robust public investment with both macro and micro policies designed to create full employment and rising wages that will incentivise private investment. if we want investment rather than speculation, and rising wages rather than runaway inequality, we need a global investment agenda that recognises that private investment starts when there are customers to buy the goods and services produced by the investments, and that investment for the public requires public investment. *american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations, visit www.aflcio.org ft (2015), “us companies on course to return $1tn to shareholders in 2015” in financial times, 12 april, www.ft.com/ imf (2015), “private investment: what’s the holdup?”, in world economic outlook: uneven growth: short- and long-term factors, imf april , washington dc, see www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01

1168@World Bank/IMF Spring 2015 meetings: Written statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee@http://www.oecd.org/finance/statement-for-international-monetary-and-financial-committee-april-2015.htm@annual meetings of the imf and world bankwritten statement to the imfc by angel gurría, oecd secretary-generalthe spring of 2015 has brought encouraging signs for the global economy. lower oil prices and widespread monetary easing have raised the potential for the acceleration of growth that is so needed in many countries, especially in europe. strong domestic demand is driving growth in the united states, which is projected to grow by 3.1% this year. ‌in japan, monetary and fiscal stimulus and higher wage settlements provide the impetus for faster near-term growth, projected at 1% this year, but longer-term challenges remain. a gradual slowdown in china, towards the “new normal” growth target, around 7%, is expected to continue. india is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy over the coming two years, projected at 7.7% this year and 8% in 2016, while the outlook is likely to worsen for many commodity-exporting nations, with brazil falling into recession.nevertheless, the near-term outlook is still one of moderate, rather than rapid, world gdp growth. real investment remains sluggish in many countries, despite highly favourable financing conditions. moreover, the recovery has yet to fully translate into more jobs and higher wages. unemployment remains far too high in many countries, while participation and wage growth often remain weak.significant risks also remain. in particular, abnormally low inflation and interest rates create a growing risk of financial instability with risk-taking and leverage driven by liquidity, rather than fundamentals. moreover, projected growth rates remain too low to fully and quickly repair labour markets. the widespread easing of monetary policy over the past few months, affecting countries accounting for roughly half of global gdp, has resulted in improvements in global financial conditions. however, a number of the associated moves in exchange rates have been large, raising the potential for overshooting in some cases. while central bank policies remain the centrepiece of the recovery, the exclusive reliance on monetary policy to manage demand should be avoided to mitigate these risks.slower growth in most emerging economies, while reflecting a necessary rebalancing, underlines the risks of financial instability. in addition, debt in many emerging economies has risen rapidly since the crisis. a full-blown financial crisis driven by foreign currency debt exposures appears less likely than in the past. however, some countries are still too dependent on portfolio inflows and short-term loans from foreign banks, and have a high share of debt in total foreign liabilities and domestic companies with large foreign currency debts.the modest recovery in advanced economies and weak inflationary pressures, with still-substantial slack in many economies, means that monetary policies should remain very accommodative. lower oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar make it appropriate for the federal reserve to wait longer before raising policy interest rates. meanwhile, in the euro area and japan, where the recovery is less established and inflation remains below target, the current monetary policy stimulus programme should be maintained for some time to come.substantial progress in fiscal consolidation has already been achieved in the united states and the euro area. with the ecb undertaking exceptional policy stimulus and given the considerable progress already made in fiscal consolidation since the crisis, fiscal policy in the euro area can be more supportive of demand, and in particular investment. the euro area’s fiscal rules are essential to the stability of the monetary union, but have created uncertainty in recent years, not least because of the repeated use of ad hoc extensions of deadlines. the uncertainty created by this approach reduces the demand benefits of any expansionary changes in policy. in japan, the government debt-to-gdp ratio is exceptionally high and presents major challenges. in the short run, boosting nominal gdp growth through a return to sustained low positive inflation will help to improve the debt dynamic. however, beyond that horizon, an extended period of fiscal consolidation will be necessary to get the public debt to gdp ratio moving down to safe levels.in china, policymakers face a significant tension between meeting growth targets and pursuing the goal of rebalancing the economy toward domestic demand, while ensuring that financial risks are managed. as the economy has slowed and the property market has weakened, further monetary stimulus and fiscal policy support measures have been put in place. in india, the quality of consolidation should be improved, with a shift in expenditure from subsidies to social and physical infrastructure. redesigning the fiscal rule in brazil to take account of the business cycle, for example by adopting an expenditure rule, would make a credible commitment to the necessary improvement in the primary balance as the economy recovers.both advanced and emerging economies face weaker growth of potential output than in the past as the result of the crisis and underlying secular trends such as demographics and narrowing scope for catch-up convergence in productivity. increasing investment is vital to raise productivity in the medium term and will be the main focus of the oecd ministerial council meeting in early june. in europe, the juncker plan provides an important opportunity to catalyse private investment using public support within the current fiscal constraints, including investment in cross-border infrastructure in network industries. the effectiveness of the plan requires full implementation of its third pillar related to the removal of regulatory obstacles to investments.continued efforts to open up trade and reduce barriers to foreign direct investment more widely will also be important. the oecd’s policy framework for investment offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to improving investment conditions, and is now being updated and enriched to build on countries’ experiences to date. the oecd’s services trade restrictiveness indicator also offers a useful tool for countries to address obstacles to trade in services. policy efforts are also needed to encourage companies to deploy their large cash piles into productive investment. tax reform and a quick and effective implementation of the g20/oecd tax initiative can help in this regard.the financing of investment by banks remains challenging as a result of ongoing adjustments in their balance sheets. a broader range of policies is needed to incentivise risk taking, and overcome investors’ reluctance to invest in the real economy, in innovation, smes and infrastructure. the oecd has been supporting such efforts, in particular via its work on institutional investors and long-term investment spearheaded by a g20/oecd task force. the oecd has also launched a large network on institutional investors and long-term investment, gathering private sector representatives engaged in long-term investment business, with the objective of further developing consultation and dialogue.there also needs to be a collective effort to fire-up the engine of trade and find ways to help countries increase their participation in international trade flows. the oecd has designed a new metric to measure global trade flows – global value chains (gvcs). gvcs challenge our conventional wisdom on how we look at economic globalisation and in particular, the policies that we develop around it. the oecd is working on several fronts to help policy makers better understand the effects of gvcs on a number of policy domains including: trade policy; investment policy; and risk assessment. momentum must also continue to tackle barriers to trade, particularly in the services sector, which today represents almost half of value added exports.action to increase investment must be accompanied by bold structural reforms. growth-friendly structural policies can help create jobs and drive innovation via stronger competition. while the pace of structural reform in emerging economies has increased over the past two years, the pace of reforms in advanced economies appears to have slowed compared with the immediate post-crisis years. some major advanced economies have undertaken considerable steps in recent years, but others have made little progress. the g20 commitment to comprehensive growth strategies at the brisbane summit in november 2014 was an important step forward. the measures are estimated by the oecd and imf to raise g20 gdp by roughly 2.1% by 2018 relative to a baseline scenario if fully implemented.countries should also adopt more effective policies to boost their innovation capacity and investment in knowledge-based assets. innovation can help accelerate the recovery and support sustainable growth. it is a powerful engine for development and for addressing social and global challenges. policies that provide an environment that is conducive to business and to investment in the knowledge infrastructure underlying innovation could play a key role in generating employment and enhancing productivity growth through cutting edge knowledge creation, application and diffusion.connecting people with jobs and protecting the vulnerablealthough unemployment is now falling, it remains very high in many economies. almost 43 million persons are currently unemployed in the oecd area, which is 10.4 million more than immediately preceding the crisis. the rise in youth unemployment is of particular concern, especially in those oecd countries where youth unemployment has risen to dramatic levels: 51.8% in spain, 50.9% in greece, 42.3% in italy, 33.5% in portugal and 26.9% in the slovak republic. in emerging economies, employment growth remains weak or heavily concentrated in informal and low-paying jobs.policies should place a greater emphasis on well-designed active labour market programmes to help workers shift from declining firms and sectors to areas of expanding job opportunities and to prevent the long-term unemployed from becoming permanently detached from the labour market. these programmes should also cover business creation, as many countries have successfully supported unemployed people and other vulnerable groups in creating their own jobs. structural labour market reforms can also encourage the creation of more and better quality jobs and improve the chances of many, including youth and other new entrants to the labour market. in some cases, this means striking a better balance between employment protection rules for permanent contracts and those for temporary contracts. tax simplification and extensions of social insurance coverage are among the measures that can help to tackle high rates of informality in many emerging economies.improving job quality is also critical, especially in emerging economies where employment is heavily concentrated in informal and low-paid jobs. the oecd uses three key dimensions of quality jobs: earnings (the level of earnings and degree of inequality); labour market security (risk of job loss and income support available); and quality of the working environment (work conditions). the good news is that the oecd analysis suggests little sign of a trade-off between job quantity and job quality. this means that policy makers do not have to choose one at the expense of the other. however, promoting job growth, while enhancing job quality, requires the support of consistent policies. these range from wage-setting arrangements and employment protection legislation to social protection schemes and occupational health and safety requirements. in the long-term, providing people with the skills they need and ensuring that they can adapt and improve those skills will also be a key to the success of countries in creating more and better jobs.given the difficult labour market context, special attention should also be given to supporting the most vulnerable groups through an adequate social safety net. at the same time, it is necessary to ensure, for those able to work, that benefits are conditional on active participation in job search and programmes to improve employability.the rise in inequality that occurred in recent decades has, if anything, picked up pace since the crisis. it has become increasingly clear that the benefits of growth do not automatically ‘trickle down’ to all sectors of society. high levels of income inequality are associated with lower social mobility, making it harder for talented and hard-working people to get the rewards they deserve. in the absence of policy action, inequality is likely to continue rising as higher-skilled workers benefit from innovation. growth must become more inclusive and more attention will have to be paid to measuring and improving well-being. the oecd has been examining new approaches to economic challenges where growth, equity, environmental concerns and wellbeing are taken into joint consideration, with a view to developing a multi-disciplinary approach allowing a better understanding of the interconnectedness of different policy areas.2015 is a year for action on the international stage. the world urgently needs to make the shift to a low carbon economy. new oecd projections carried out under naec suggest that world gdp in 2060 may cumulatively shrink by between 0.7% and 2.5%, should global temperature increase between 1.5º and 4.5ºc. the un process will be central in catalysing action and securing the necessary political will to finalise an ambitious, global legal climate agreement at cop 21 in 2015. the oecd green growth strategy highlights the importance of eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, introducing an appropriate price on carbon and removing barriers to the mobilisation of investment in green technologies. but these environmental policies won’t be sufficient to achieve the transition to low carbon-economies. many other policies in areas including tax policy, regulatory policy, or urban planning also have an impact on the amount of carbon emitted as well as on cost and hence need to be aligned with our goal of achieving zero net emissions in the second half of this century. together with the international energy agency, the nuclear energy agency and the international transport forum the oecd has launched a project to explicitly look at these non-environmental policies and see how they could be better aligned with the low-carbon transition.the effort to fight against tax evasion and avoidance must continue apace. a total of 93 jurisdictions have committed themselves to implement the new global standard for automatic exchange of information (aeoi) for tax purposes in either 2017 or 2018. in cooperation with the world bank group, the 126-country global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax old site provides assistance to interested developing countries to implement and benefit from the automatic exchange standard. the oecd is also working to strengthen awareness and co-operate across government agencies on effective approaches to tackle illicit tax evasion, money laundering and bribery. the oecd/g20 tax (beps) project is tackling gaps in international tax rules that enable multinational enterprises to exploit loopholes in the current rules and minimize their tax payments in both developed and developing countries. with eight of the fifteen actions still to be delivered by the end of this year, we will address some of the most egregious arrangements used by multinationals to separate their corporate profits from the location of their underlying economic activities.collective action must also continue in the fight against corruption. corruption is one of the greatest impediments to growth and development. it also erodes trust in governments, businesses and markets. we have to recover this trust if economic reforms are to deliver, and this can only be accomplished through effective and inclusive multilateral cooperation. the anti-bribery convention is the cornerstone of oecd efforts to combat corruption. the working group on bribery will continue its efforts to increase the enforcement of foreign bribery in the 41 parties to the convention. this work will be complemented by our new trust and business (tnb) project that focuses on how to close the implementation gap between the actual conduct of businesses and the standards we have put forward. finally, the oecd has convened a high-level advisory group on anti-corruption comprising distinguished experts to take forward the oecd’s anti-corruption strategy.global efforts to promote sustainable investment and ensure that business investments benefit society will also be necessary. the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises are the most comprehensive set of recommendations on responsible business conduct addressed by governments to their multinational enterprises operating at home or abroad. oecd work helps enterprises carry out due diligence in specific sectors to help businesses identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address actual and potential adverse impacts as an integral part of their operations. a unique aspect of the guidelines are the national contact points (ncp), which, inter alia, provide access to remedy those affected by adverse business impacts related to the non-observance of labour, environmental, human rights and other standards reflected in the guidelines. so

(read full speech here)financing smes and entrepreneurs 2015: an oecd scoreboard, says bank lending to smes has still not recovered to pre-crisis levels in many countries, putting the brakes on business growth and investment. although credit conditions have generally eased, they remain tight, especially for smes.some alternative instruments such as crowdfunding and factoring are gaining traction but venture capital investment and leasing have yet to recover to 2007 levels in most countries. the oecd warns that high levels of non-performing loans among smes have a negative effect on banks’ willingness to lend and pose a particular threat to economic recovery in the countries most affected by the financial crisis.however, payment delays and bankruptcies among smes were no longer on the rise in 2013. bankruptcies remained on average at their 2012 levels while payment delays fell in a majority of the 34 countries surveyed in the scoreboard.financing smes and entrepreneurs 2015: an oecd scoreboard is an annual report that analyses indicators on sme finance, complemented by demand-side information and an overview of the latest public and private initiatives. it provides a comprehensive source of information on the state of sme finance.new approaches to sme and entrepreneurship financing: broadening the range of instruments highlights the fact that traditional bank finance poses challenges to smes, in particular to newer, innovative and fast-growing firms with a higher risk profile. the same applies to companies in transition such as those going through a change of ownership or control.the report considers that diversified funding sources for smes can better serve the needs of firms at different stages of their life cycle, as well as help to mitigate systemic risk, strengthen the economy’s resilience to critical shocks and foster new sources of growth.it maps the main features of a broad range of external financing techniques acting as alternatives to straight debt, including asset-based finance, alternative debt, hybrid instruments, and equity instruments.the report indicates that it is now essential to address the obstacles that are limiting smes’ use of a broader range of financial instruments by:• designing regulation that balances financial stability, investor protection and the development of innovative financing channels for smes;to find out more about the oecd’s work on smes and entrepreneurship, please visit: http://www.oecd.org/cfe/smes.for more information about these two reports, please contact miriam koreen, deputy director of the centre for entrepreneurship, smes and local development at the oecd (tel. +33 1 45 24 81 41); lucia cusmano and kris boschmans or the oecd media division (news.contact@oecd.org; tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00)."
1170@Financial education for migrants and their families@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5js4h5rw17vh-en@money remitted by international migrants is a major source of income for many countries around the world, exceeding all international development funds combined. yet individual migrants and their families are often amongst the most vulnerable people in society, and many face significant barriers to the access and use of appropriate financial products. recognising their importance and vulnerability, some home and host countries are taking measures to support migrant workers and their families and improve their financial literacy; in some cases this occurs within the framework of a national strategy for financial education. in order to increase the extent of such support and to improve international co-operation, this paper seeks to illustrate the key challenges and suggest possible ways forward. the lessons learned will be used by the oecd and its international network on financial education to develop a checklist for policy makers in order to increase the coverage of high-quality financial education for migrants.

1176@Economic stagnation compounds demographic pressure on pension systems, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/finance/demographic-change-and-economic-stagnation-put-pressure-onpension-systems.htm@08/12/2014 - low growth, low interest rates and low returns on investment linked to the slow global economy are now compounding the problems of population ageing for both public and private pension systems, according to a new oecd report.the oecd pensions outlook 2014 says that the crisis spurred most countries to speed up reforms to make their pension systems more financially sustainable. these included raising taxes on pension income and pension contributions, reducing or deferring the indexation of pension benefits, and increasing the statutory retirement age.but ensuring that people extend their careers to ensure an adequate retirement and that the financial burden is more fairly shared across generations remain key challenges.“it’s encouraging to see the progress made in recent years to make pension systems more sustainable and adequate,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “but the ongoing rapid demographic shift and the slowdown in the global economy highlight the need for continuing reforms. we must communicate better the message that working longer and contributing more is the only way to get a decent income in retirement.”increasing the effective retirement age can help but more efforts are needed to assist older workers find and retain jobs. public policies to reduce age discrimination, improve working conditions and increase training opportunities for older workers are essential.countries have also introduced reforms to strengthen funded private pensions. the report highlights the importance of increasing coverage rates in countries where funded pensions are voluntary. auto-enrolment programs have been successful in raising coverage in the countries that have implemented them.the report also calls for strengthening the regulatory framework to help pension funds and annuity providers deal with the uncertainty around improving life expectancy. it argues that regulators should make sure that providers use regularly updated mortality tables, which incorporate future improvements in mortality and life expectancy. failure to account for such improvements can result in a shortfall of provisions of well over 10% of the pension and annuity liabilities.capital markets could offer additional capacity for mitigating longevity risk, but the transparency, standardization and liquidity of instruments to hedge this risk need to be facilitated. the regulatory framework will also need to reflect the reduction of risk exposure these instruments offer by ensuring they are appropriately valued by accounting standards and lowering the level of required capital for entities hedging their longevity risk.issuing longevity bonds and publishing a longevity index to serve as a benchmark for the pricing and risk assessment of hedges would support the development of longevity instruments.rebuilding trust is also an important challenge that policy makers face, says the oecd. young people in particular need to trust the long-term stability of the pension system and the pension promise that is made to them. communication campaigns and individual pension statements to explain the need for reform and facilitate choice by individuals are needed, says the oecd.for comment or further information, journalists should contact pablo antolin of the oecd’s financial affairs division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 90 86) or hervé boulhol of the oecd’s social policy division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 84 58).

1178@Emerging Trends and Challenges in Official Financing - Paris Club Forum@http://www.oecd.org/finance/public-debt/emerging-trends-and-challenges-in-official-financing.htm@paris club forum – “emerging trends and challenges in official financing”fresh from the g20 summit in brisbane, i am delighted to be here today for this important forum, organised jointly by the australian presidency and the paris club.i feel well-placed to contribute to the debate today, both as secretary-general of the oecd, which counts many paris club countries among its membership, and as former foreign minister and finance minister of mexico in the mid-to-late 1990s. i have experienced two major financial crises ‘up close and personal’: the tequila crisis and the great recession. i have also been at a too close for comfort distance from the ‘tango crisis’ (editions i, ii and iii); the asian troubles of 1997 and the russian turbulence of 2008.past failures should have taught us important lessons about sustainable sovereign debt restructuring, but we are learning only slowly, as the ongoing argentine saga demonstrates. this issue is not confined to emerging economies, as the greek tragedy has shown. amounting to €200bn, this was the biggest sovereign default of all time. it should and could have been handled better, and we are still trying to work it out!the world of official financing has been transformed in recent decadeslet me start with a word on the transformation in the financing architecture for global development in recent decades.for a start, there has been massive growth in private financial flows to middle-income countries (mics) and emerging markets. for lower income countries, there is an increasing diversity of official aid, including increased south-south collaboration and, of late, a significant rise in new bond issuance by so-called frontier markets,[i] this includes new, first-time issuers in the international sovereign debt market,[ii] particularly sub-saharan african countries.both demand and supply factors underpin this surge in issuers, reflecting increased investor ‘search for yield’ in a prolonged low interest rate environment globally as well as improved economic fundamentals in developing and emerging economies. in many respects, this is good news for these countries,[iii] which are now better placed to finance government investment in infrastructure and human capital at affordable rates.but the composition of holders of sovereign debt has changed over the years: bank loan syndicates that were prevalent in the 1970s have been increasingly replaced by dispersed and diverse bondholders. this shift was first evidenced in the mexican crisis of 1994-1995. while there are benefits to a diversified investor base, it has heightened information asymmetries and collective action problems, thereby creating major creditor coordination problems.sovereign debt management remains in flux and in need of policy solutionsthis new context also gives rise to new policy challenges. excessive borrowing, in particular on international markets and in foreign currency, exposes countries to various financial stability risks when the local or global economic tide ebbs.[iv]for example, normalisation of the highly accommodative monetary policy stance in advanced markets may lead to sudden reversals of capital flows to developing countries. this could put sudden pressures on exchange rates, official reserves and bond prices. in an extreme situation, if these pressures are accompanied by a steep fall in economic growth, sovereign debt sustainability concerns could emerge, potentially triggering a sovereign debt crisis.the crises in the 1990s prompted a debate that is still ongoing on the need for changes in how sovereign debt is restructured. new restructuring instruments should tackle information and coordination challenges and make the process less messy and less costly. this key insight from the mexican crisis was subsequently reinforced by the asian, brazilian and argentine crises.for many reasons argentina has not been able to re-access the international capital markets since 2001, despite debt swaps in 2005 and 2010[v]. the recent litigation – and, one might say, activist judicial interpretation of a pari passu clause – has further aggravated the argentine case by giving unreasonable leverage to so-called ‘professional holdouts’, who hold less than 10% of the country’s outstanding sovereign debt.this interpretation, if applied more generally, could substantially increase the leverage of hold-out creditors and complicate creditor coordination[vi]. this injects a certain degree of urgency into the debate on sovereign debt restructuring and puts it up to the global policy community to articulate a coherent response.we need market solutions where possible, and state intervention only when necessaryin the oecd’s view, there are basically two distinct approaches to solve creditor coordination problems that could be followed:• first, a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (sdrm) based on a statutory approach; and• second, contract reform as part of an evolving market-based approach, principally through collective action clauses (cacs).both approaches are designed to tackle collective action problems while encouraging an orderly debt restructuring process.at the oecd, we question the effectiveness of the first approach: statutory mechanisms for restructuring sovereign debt. for instance:• why would a treaty-based insolvency regime work when, as is often the case, debt restructuring cases can better be classified as ‘won’t pays’ rather than ‘can’t pays’?• why would bondholders voluntarily subordinate their claims to an untested regime?• how could a statutory mechanism remain relevant given the pace of financial innovation and structural change in official financing?• how could we satisfactorily coordinate the conflicting interests of countries and investors under a statutory mechanism if parties are then likely to try to circumvent it after the fact?indeed, these are some of the reasons why both borrowers and lenders rejected the imf’s proposal for a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism a decade ago.instead, the oecd would suggest that a market-based mechanism is the best approach. central to this must be collective action clauses designed to align creditors towards a workable debt restructuring proposal. to make cacs relatively immune to unreasonable leverage by holdouts, and amend or clarify the pari passu – or equal treatment clause to allow contracting parties to ensure that courts do not order debtors to pay holdout creditors whenever they pay restructured creditors.[vii] this would ensure that equal treatment does not necessarily mean equal payment, because amended or clarified pari passu clauses would clearly exclude ratable payment injunctions. mexico recently decided to adopt these two types of changes for use in its new sovereign debt contracts.[viii]but the aim would not be to eliminate holdouts at all costs, as this could undermine the very viability of sovereign financing in its current form. creditors – including holdouts – should retain a meaningful voice. contracts should therefore include thresholds so that there is some reasonable blocking capacity for creditors who wish to stay out.for example, recent bonds issued by kazakhstan and mexico include new cacs that would compel all bondholders to accept restructuring terms if at least 75 % agree.[ix] for its part, the international capital market association has recently endorsed the aggregation of cacs in this manner. this is a workable, common-sense approach that would retain the essence of the current system while ironing out the kinks. the next step would be to include other government liabilities, guarantees and trade credits in the aggregation process.in an interconnected world, policy challenges are increasingly international in nature. these global challenges need a global response, and the g20 is at present the premier forum for coordinating these policy solutions. recognising the urgency injected into this debate by recent judicial developments, the g20 has stepped up to the plate.the brisbane communiqué welcomed “international work on strengthened collective action and pari passu clauses”, called for “their inclusion in international sovereign bonds” and encouraged “the international community and private sector to actively promote their use”. so, we will play our part, but the ball is in your court!the oecd will continue to work with our member and partner countries, with private sector stakeholders, and through the g20, with the incoming turkish presidency. together, let’s strive for win-win solutions for debtors and creditors alike, for sustainable global development, and for better official financing policies for better lives.
1179@Inducing Private Finance for Renewable Energy Projects: Evidence from Micro-Data - Environment Working Paper@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxvg0k6thr1-en@this paper analyses the effects of government policies on flows of private finance for investment in renewable energy (inducement effect). it also examines whether direct provision of public finance for a project increases the volume of private finance raised (“crowding in” effect). a unique dataset of financial transactions for renewable energy projects with worldwide coverage is constructed using the bloomberg new energy finance database. the analysis covers 87 countries, six renewable energy sectors (wind, solar, biomass, small hydropower, marine and geothermal) and the 2000-2011 time-span. main findings are that, in contrast to quota-based schemes, price-based support schemes are positively correlated with investors’ ability to raise private finance. the paper suggests that, rather than the type of instrument (price vs. quota), it is the specific design of such schemes that is key to providing a predictable signal and an effective incentive to attract private investors. it is also found that public finance supports precisely those projects that have had difficulty raising private finance (co-financed projects), where neither quota-based measures nor price-based support schemes have a significant effect on private finance flows. this raises the concern that in the absence of well-designed policies which incentivise private finance investment, governments wishing to secure project completion have no other choice than to support projects directly through the use of public finance.

1181@The post-2015 agenda must steer a transformational shift towards sustainable development@http://www.oecd.org/finance/the-post-2015-agenda-must-steer-a-transformational-shift-towards-sustainable-development.htm@side event: curbing illicit financial flows for domestic resource mobilisation and sustainable development in the post-2015 erathank you for attending this event co-hosted by australia, mexico and the oecd on “curbing illicit financial flows for domestic resource mobilisation and sustainable development in the post-2015 era”. your presence here today underlines the importance of this issue for the international community in the context of the post-2015 agenda.indeed, we are at a critical juncture. as the millennium development goals (mdgs) approach their expiry date, we must focus our efforts on ensuring a brighter, more inclusive and sustainable future for all. this is no walk in the park. the new international framework must respond to the demands of our highly complex and interconnected global economy. we face a plethora of common issues, including: growing inequalities; changing consumption patterns and population dynamics; increasing natural resource scarcity; and ongoing illicit financial flows.these global challenges call for a genuine global response. a greater coherence of stakeholders on core policy issues is imperative. that is why the oecd is committed to making policy coherence for sustainable development a central pillar of the post-2015 agenda.and one area where policy coherence for development has the potential to make a real difference is in the fight against illicit financial flows.the recent reports of the un open working group (owg) and the intergovernmental committee of experts on sustainable development financing (icesdf) both highlight the need to deal with the systemic conditions that hamper the use and mobilisation of countries’ own resources for sustainable development.tackling illicit financial flows will not only be critical to meet the challenge of financing a more ambitious post-2015 development agenda. but also to create an enabling international environment that allows each and every country to pursue national sustainable development strategies.illicit financial flows stemming from corruption, money laundering, tax evasion, and other crimes are among the biggest obstacles to mobilising resources for development. the numbers are disputed, but it is likely that illicit outflows significantly exceed the inflows from aid and foreign direct investment in many developing countries.these flows strip resources that could be used to finance much needed public services, such as health care and education, and ultimately to finance sustainable development. a mere portion of these funds would have significant positive impact: it is estimated that every $100 million recovered could fund full immunisations for 4 million children or provide water connections for some 250 000 households in a developing country. [1]we need coherent and collective action and we need it now. in developing countries, illicit flows are often a symptom of deeper governance failures, including weak institutions and high levels of corruption. these countries need to improve the efficiency of their tax systems and tackle corruption in order to mobilise their domestic resources more effectively.but the fight against international illicit financial flows is not limited to developing countries. it entails a shared responsibility for all. unfortunately, many illicit flows end up in oecd countries. without action they risk becoming safe havens for illicit flows from developing countries.greater policy coherence is therefore critical. from crime control to regulations in the financial sector, and tax regimes, its implications require cross-sectoral and cross-national responses.the oecd – a champion for more coherent policies to fight illicit financial flows.the oecd stands at the forefront of international efforts to combat corruption, fight against tax crime and tackle other illicit financial flows. we do so by partnering with relevant stakeholders and fostering knowledge sharing and policy coherence. as we are here today.last year, as part of our strategy for development, we released our first report measuring oecd members’ efforts to curb illicit financial flows. and this year we produced a report which shows that coherent policies in oecd countries in areas such as tax evasion, anti-bribery and money laundering can contribute to reducing illicit financial flows from developing countries. it is important that we keep our member countries on their toes.we are also intensifying our work to contribute to an international enabling environment for sustainable development with an arsenal of ‘soft laws’, benchmarks, studies and peer pressure mechanisms in a wide range of policy areas. let me mention a few examples:• tax avoidance strategies, though they may be legal, are unfair. they deprive governments from much needed tax revenues, crucial to invest in infrastructure, implement sustainable growth policies and move people out of poverty. 2 trillion us dollars in profits are stashed offshore to avoid taxation. [2] this situation is no longer acceptable. our work on base erosion and profit shifting (beps), launched in 2012 upon a request by the g20 attempts to tackle the planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to make profits ‘disappear’ for tax purposes or to shift profits to locations where taxes are low.in effect, we are working on new international tax rules for the 21st century. all non-oecd g20 countries participate in the beps project on an equal footing, and we have also established an in-depth engagement approach to better understand the most significant beps issues for developing countries. we have put in place a 15-point action plan that we will roll out over the coming 18 months. this action plan will allow all countries to draw up co-ordinated, comprehensive and transparent tax standards which match up with modern business practices.• efforts to improve international tax transparency will also help governments fight tax fraud and tax evasion. the oecd has developed a new single standard for the automatic exchange of tax information, under a mandate from the g20, endorsed by g20 finance ministers in february, and approved by the oecd council. the 122 members of the global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes will monitor its implementation and work to ensure that developing countries can fully benefit from participation in this standard. furthermore, the global forum continues to ensure that members can effectively exchange information upon request thanks to a robust peer review process and the provision of technical assistance in particular in developing countries.• our work on tax inspectors without borders helps developing countries bolster their domestic revenues by making their tax systems fairer and more effective. furthermore, this june, with the help of our italian colleagues, we launched the “oecd international academy for tax crime investigations” which has already trained more than 60 investigators and law enforcement officials from developing countries.• last but not least, our fight against one of the biggest systemic threats of the 21st century – corruption – continues through the oecd’s anti-bribery convention, which has helped governments to enforce anti-bribery laws and secure convictions. we also have the cleangovbiz initiative, which draws together the oecd’s anti-corruption tools, reinforces their implementation, improves co-ordination among relevant players and monitors progress towards integrity.with 2015 just around the corner, we face a moment of opportunity. we must work together to ensure that the post-2015 agenda provides us with a coherent framework to steer a transformational shift towards sustainable development.we have a shared responsibility to reduce all forms of illicit financial flows, and their negative impacts on sustainable development. in this effort, policy coherence provides us with a tool to make this happen. in designing a post-2015 world let’s think coherence!the oecd, as always, stands ready to work with you. i wish you all the best in your discussions.

1185@The Bitcoin Question: Currency versus Trust-less Transfer Technology@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2pwjd9t20-en@the financial crisis has led to a widespread loss of trust in financial intermediaries of all kinds, perhaps helping to open the way towards the general acceptance of alternative technologies. this paper briefly summarises the crypto-currency phenomenon, separating the ‘currency’ issues from the potential technology benefits. with respect to crypto currencies, the paper argues that these can’t undermine the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy. they do, however, raise consumer protection and bank secrecy issues. the valuation of bitcoins and price volatility issues are discussed, as well as electronic theft, contract failures, etc., all of which could result in large losses to users and hence ultimate costs to the taxpayer (e.g. the failure to provide adequate private pensions resulting in increased reliance on public pensions). the anonymity features of the crypto-currencies also facilitate tax evasion and money laundering, both of which are major public policy concerns. the technology associated with crypto-currencies, on the other hand, could ultimately shift the entire basis of trust involved in any financial transaction. it is an innovation that creates the ability to carry out transactions without the need for a trusted third party; i.e. a move towards trust-less transactions. this mechanism could work to eliminate the role of many intermediaries, thereby reducing transactions costs by introducing much needed competition to incumbent firms. the generic issues that policy makers need to examine are summarised.

1191@Trust and the Wealth of Nations@http://www.oecd.org/finance/trust-and-the-wealth-of-nations.htm@"in the 17th arrondissement of paris you can walk past a bust of the 19-20th century french writer, tristan bernard. it carries a maxim that always makes me smile, roughly translated: only trust yourself and then not very much. (""ne compter que sur soi-même et encore pas beaucoup. "") it is simple, but invites reflection on the staggering level of trust that each of us invests in countless fellow humans. every day we have contact with hundreds of people and trust their civility. our high standards of living and social well-being rely on trust in thousands more–to teach our children, cure illnesses or present us with clean water from the tap, etc.! of course the fundamental elements of trust among people are regulated by strict law (for example against doing wilful harm to others). but much of the behaviour we expect from others is not about obeying the law–but rests on deeply ingrained shared concepts of civility. public and private institutions–for example, schools, the family, religious beliefs or businesses and media--promote social and cultural norms that contribute to trust. similarly, much of economic behaviour is based on trust. true, the functioning of markets are governed by many sets of rules for engagement among individual s and companies: competition rules, accounting and disclosure rules, laws to protect labour rights, payment rights, investor and creditor rights, laws to protect the environment. and, governments establish the means to control whether the rules are followed and to enforcement them. but no regulator or inspector is watching every element of every transaction. we trust people to be honest (and we think we have a collective idea of what that means). in democracies we rely on politics to balance interests in forming social and economic rules. but what happens if we stop believing that politics delivers rules that are fair? in politics, does everyone have their fair say? in economics, does every worker or business get their fair chance? individuals and companies can accept failure to win a job or contract, if they feel that the rules and the systems give equal chances. in the wake of the recent financial and economic crises doubts have arisen about the systems that set the rules. what happens when there is interaction across national borders? let’s focus on economics – the heart of the oecd. countries have very different histories and traditions; behaviour is different and perceptions of behaviour (of strangers!) will differ. economies are organised along different lines. and they enjoy widely different standards of living. in fact, the exchange of goods and investments is based on the idea of using these valuable differences, in skills, natural resources, assets and the like, to promote well-being among workers, consumers, entrepreneurs, youths, retirees, etc. international exchange depends on trusting that the rules of engagement are fair. without this trust, politics will lead to protectionist impulses. many people work to foster international trust. governments and private actors sponsor education and cultural exchanges. in the economic sphere, governments have negotiated bilateral and regional treaties and created international organisations like the oecd and the wto. governments have also negotiated and agreed broad standards on human or labour rights, for example. the oecd’s founding convention is dedicated to promoting global well-being. its agreed rules on open capital markets and against bribery in international business, and its standards on investment rules, corporate governance, responsible business conduct, to name a few, are expressly designed to create shared expectations about the conduct of governments and companies in order to promote trust and exchange. these standards are not the product of the imagination of a few bureaucrats; they are built upon facts and analysis and the experience of dozens of countries around the world. they are debated at length so that we achieve shared understanding. our standards are aspirational; no country would score 100% on any one of them. they chart a direction. they are open to others and they are open to improvement. engaging and working together on shared solutions help us trust each other more–possibly even more than trusting in just ourselves. oecd directorate for financial and enterprise affairs"
1192@Sovereign borrowing set to fall in 2014, says OECD@http://www.oecd.org/finance/sovereign-borrowing-set-to-fall-in-2014.htm@28/03/2014 - borrowing operations by oecd governments are set to decrease, as their borrowing needs continue to decline, according to a new oecd report. net borrowing needs are projected to fall from usd 2.0 trillion in 2013 to usd 1.5 trillion in 2014, the lowest level since 2007.the sovereign borrowing outlook 2014 estimates that gross borrowing requirements will total usd 10.6 trillion in 2014, down from usd 10.8 trillion in 2013. the redemption profile of medium- and long-term central government debt in the oecd area remains challenging, according to the outlook, with large projected payment flows for the g7 and euro area governments for 2013 and 2014. for the oecd area as a whole, governments will need to refinance close to 29 % of its outstanding long-term debt in the next 3 years.central government marketable debt as a percentage of gdp is projected to reach 77.1% in 2014, slightly up from 77% in 2013. the good news, says the report, is that debt ratios of country groupings are increasing at a significantly slower pace than at the height of the crisis or even show a stabilising trend.continuing volatility in global markets, combined with uncertainties about the timing of the us federal reserve tapering and quantitative easing exits elsewhere, will continue to pose challenges for debt managers, according to the outlook. skilful debt management, supported by a transparent monetary exit and a prudent fiscal strategy, will be needed to avoid a return to dysfunctional markets, including higher stress in inter-banking markets and sovereign debt markets.on the issue of “safe” sovereign assets, the oecd finds no evidence of a structural shortage in supply. it estimates that their supply has actually increased since the start of the crisis: between 2007 and 2014, the outstanding amount of aaa-rated longer-term central government debt securities data for oecd countries is projected to increase by more than usd 6 trillion.governments are also set to issue more long-term debt, with the share of short-term issuance in 2014 expected to remain in the range 45-46%, well below the pre-crisis share of almost 49%.for more information, journalists should contact hans blommestein, head of bond market and public debt management at the oecd: tel. + 33 1 45 24 79 90. they can obtain a copy of the report via the password-protected site or from the oecd’s media division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).

1205@Equity markets, corporate governance and value creation@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/fmt-2013-5k40m1ntmhzs@this article provides both an analytical framework for the role of public policy in corporate governance and a description of the empirical context that influences the conditions for that policy. it underlines the importance of focusing on the overall economic outcome and, in particular, how rules and regulations impact the conditions for companies to grow and create value by accessing public equity markets. in terms of the empirical context, we point to fundamental changes in the functioning of equity markets that may call for a fresh look at the economic effectiveness of corporate governance regulations. among other things, we document a dramatic shift in listings from developed to emerging markets over the last decade, which means that concentrated ownership at company level has become the dominant form of ownership in listed companies worldwide.we also discuss whether the lack of new listings of smaller companies in developed markets is related to excessive regulatory burdens and unintended consequences of a decade of profound stock market deregulation. the discussion about listings illustrates that corporate governance rules and regulations do not only affect companies that are already listed. from a policy perspective, it is equally important to assess the implications for unlisted companies that may, in the future, require access to public equity markets for growth and job creation. we also document how the lengthened and ever more complex chain of intermediaries between savers and companies may influence the efficiency of capital allocation and the willingness of investors to take an active long-term interest in the companies that they own. it is shown that institutional investors are a highly heterogeneous group and that their willingness and ability to engage in corporate governance primarily depend on the economic incentives that follow from their different business models, investment strategies and trading practices.we provide examples of how regulatory initiatives to increase shareholder engagement may have unintended consequences, and note that the diversity and complexity of the investment chain can render general policies or regulation ineffective.

1217@Fixing finance@http://www.oecd.org/finance/fixing-finance.htm@there are good reasons why the public has lost confidence in banking and finance. two issues in particular must be addressed before it can be restored– moral hazard and conflict of interest. reforms should ensure that banks and bankers–not taxpayers–pay the price of failure and are held fully accountable for their actions. confidence in the financial sector has taken some sharp hits since the financial crisis started: subprime mortgages traded as triple-a investments, trillions in bailouts and lost output, rogue traders losing their banks billions, the libor rate-fixing scandal, etc. all these scandals revolve to a large extent around the two main shortcomings that afflict the financial sector: moral hazard and conflict of interest. the first issue, moral hazard, refers to a situation where someone has an incentive to take a bigger risk because they know someone else will pay the bill if it doesn’t pay off. in short, “heads i win, tails you lose!” in the financial sector, this issue is everywhere. on the trading floor, traders get a nice bonus if their risks pay off; if they don’t, it’s their employer or client who bears the loss. at the top of the hierarchy, chief executives at big global banks get vast bonuses when they are successful and attractive severance packages when they leave, sometimes even when they have done a poor job. at a macroeconomic level, banks that are “too big to fail” can reap great profits from bets that go well, whereas losses that threaten their existence are borne by taxpayers in the form of bailouts. let’s take a closer look at bailouts. traditional commercial banks provide essential services throughout our economies: supplying loans to businesses and families, safeguarding savings and providing payment services. letting a big commercial bank go bankrupt is therefore a risk that no government wants to take. however, in today’s financial system, big commercial banks are usually also big investment banks engaging in a totally different type of banking, which tends to be more risky and speculative. on average, large european banks dedicate less than 30% of their balance sheet to lending to households and nonfinancial companies and institutions. when the investment-banking arm of these universal banks pushes them over the edge in a catastrophic scenario, governments have no choice but to bail them out in order to avoid major disruptions in the functioning of the economy. to make things worse, the high degree of interconnectedness in the financial sector means that even pure investment banks need public guarantees if they are considered big enough to pull universal banks down with them. universal banks, especially those deemed “too big to fail” or “systemically important”, thus enjoy an implicit government guarantee. this makes them a less risky option for lenders and thereby drives down their borrowing cost compared to smaller or more specialised banks. this distorts not only competition, but also the very funding structure of banks: on average, european commercial banks need to finance 15% of their loans with wholesale funding to bridge the gap with deposits, whereas their trading activities bring this proportion to 50%. as wholesale funding is by its nature more volatile than deposits, the combination of both activities (lending and trading) leads to increased volatility in the funding structure of universal banks as a whole, including their commercial banking activities. to put it simply, the implicit government guarantee gives large universal banks an incentive to leverage their balance sheets to the detriment of traditional commercial banking activities. in good times, taxpayers benefit very little from the guarantee they provide but, in times of crisis, they pay heavily. in short: private gains, public losses.  putting an end to moral hazard is essential. this requires, among other things, a clear separation of commercial and investment banking activities to ensure that taxpayers are insulated from providing a guarantee for risky and speculative activities. such a separation could actually give an impulse to economic growth and increase the competitiveness of the financial sector thanks to its impact on banks’ size and complexity. indeed, it would shrink both the size of banks and the banking sector as a whole, which, as a recent study from the bank for international settlements (bis) shows, would have a positive impact on economic growth. either way, the simple argument that banks should be able to absorb losses or even go bankrupt without pulling down the entire economy is incontestable. at the european level, a high-level expert group led by erkki liikanen, the governor of the bank of finland, has advised the european commission to take steps towards a separation of trading activities. at finance watch we applaud this recommendation, even though we fear that it does not go far enough. it is therefore crucial that these proposals be understood as a strict minimum among the reforms needed. the second issue that needs to be tackled to restore trust is conflict of interest, which is ubiquitous in the financial sector. take the libor scandal: banks are asked to submit the interest rates they have been paying for their short-term financing. at the same time, they hold financial instruments whose value is determined by libor, and they depend on libor for their financing costs. the rate, therefore, has a significant impact on their profitability. influencing liborby fabricating quotes then becomes a temptation. another example of conflict of interest can be seen with financial advisors. in many, if not most, cases, a financial advisor has strong financial incentives to steer clients in a direction that does not serve their best interests. when an advisor gains financially from promoting certain products, he or she becomes nothing but a salesperson in disguise. to tackle conflict of interest, regulation is needed that blocks or neutralises perverse incentives. also, within financial institutions, employees, management and executives must be held responsible for their acts, as well as the corporation itself. the public has lost confidence in our banks since 2008, and not without justification. despite this, far-reaching reforms are still lacking, meaning that for many banks post-crisis banking is business as usual. both moral hazard and conflict of interest remain pervasive. but the problem is by no means set in stone, and the solution today involves changing the rules of the game. a new framework for the financial sector would benefit everyone in the long run: citizens and entrepreneurs would operate in a less crisisprone economic environment, bankers would be able to win back the trust of the public and of investors, and regulators would not have to worry about losing control over a leviathan financial sector that can pull down the world economy. cecchetti, s.g. and e. kharroubi (2012), “reassessing the impact of finance on growth”, bis working papers no.

1219@Written Statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee - April 2013@http://www.oecd.org/finance/written-statement-to-international-monetary-and-financial-committee-april2013.htm@after a marked slowdown in late 2012, the global economy appears now to be picking up. output growth was weak in most advanced countries in the last quarter of 2012 and the increase in global trade volumes came to a virtual halt. growth among emerging economies has remained much faster than that of advanced countries on average, although with significant differences across countries.the outlook in the first half of 2013 is for a return to moderate growth in the united states and an acceleration from low levels in japan, boosted by new policy measures. in europe, a meaningful recovery is likely to take somewhat longer but prospects for the euro-area should improve during the year. the receding of negative tail risks in the united states and the euro area in late 2012 and early 2013, together with abundant liquidity, was an important factor behind the marked strengthening of financial markets in recent months. equity prices in oecd economies have surged, corporate bond spreads have narrowed and, despite a number of negative shocks, sovereign spreads in the euro area periphery moved down substantially in the last quarter of 2012 and have declined further in 2013.this builds also on the policy actions taken in recent years, including the effect of supportive monetary policy. fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are progressing, especially in the euro area where great strides have been made to reduce structural budget deficits. albeit asymmetric, the process of euro area rebalancing is underway and competitiveness is adjusting.however, despite the recent news, the situation remains fragile and a sustainable recovery is yet to be secured.in the euro area, the on-going deep recessions in italy and spain - as well as the virtual standstill in france – raise serious questions about the recovery and remain a threat to the achievement of fiscal consolidation plans and the stability of the financial system. within the euro area, there is a renewed divergence between growth in germany, which is likely to achieve moderate growth in the first half of 2013, and that of other countries, which is projected to remain slow or negative.labour market slack remains substantial in many oecd countries, and the employment situation has continued to deteriorate in the euro area, contributing to depressed consumer confidence. in europe especially, the rise of long-term unemployment, with more of the unemployed moving off unemployment insurance onto less generous social benefits, is worsening poverty and inequality. even in the united states, where job growth has been reasonably strong in recent quarters, the proportion of the working-age population in employment remains well below pre-crisis levels and has risen only slightly from its post-crisis lows. in japan, the unemployment rate has been declining since mid-2009, but is still higher than in 2007.there is also a risk that global imbalances and financial stability issues have not been addressed adequately and problems will emerge again as the economy picks up. in most advanced economies, banks’ efforts to repair balance sheets remain ongoing. this is holding back loan growth. bank lending has recently picked up somewhat in the united states, the united kingdom and switzerland. but in the euro area, it has continued to contract, even before the hit to confidence from the drawn-out resolution of the banking crisis in cyprus. the fragmentation and fragility of the banking system remains fundamentally at the heart of weak credit availability and low growth in the eurozone. this is of great concern as the european economy is much more dependent on bank finance than the us economy. and the euro area remains the region where negative tail risks appear most prominent, because feedback loops between banking system fragility and government debt burdens have not been severed. a full banking union is needed for the euro area, not just for the future but also to get the economy moving again.financing of long-term investment is made difficult not only by the lack of banking credit but also by the rarefaction of equity finance. with the compression of yields, the preference for debt-financing has increased at the expense of equity, which is essential for the financing of long-term investment, especially for new ventures and high-growth innovative firms. furthermore, in an environment of weak sales growth and high uncertainty, corporates have been hoarding cash and privileging dividends and share buybacks at the expense of investment. this is particularly noticeable in some key sectors like technology and healthcare. in this uncertain post-crisis environment, companies that give cash back to shareholders tend to be favoured by equity markets, punishing companies that embark on long-term investment.more generally, global financial markets show signs of renewed exuberance that is increasingly out of line with fundamentals. this gaping disconnect between the financial sector and the real economy should be a source of concern. in particular, large banks’ business models have not changed enough from the pre-crisis era. banks remain over-reliant on trading activities and derivatives. in light of the recent compression of yields, a sharp correction in debt markets cannot be ruled out that would worsen the already fragile financial situation of many banks in oecd countries, in the euro-area in particular. also, markets in some emerging economies show signs of overheating and are witnessing worrying credit booms.as a self-sustained recovery is not fully assured, bold policy action to support activity remains necessary in all major oecd economies. demand in many countries still faces strong headwinds from private-sector deleveraging, necessary fiscal consolidation and impaired bank credit provision.given limited fiscal space in most oecd countries, monetary policy remains a key instrument for supporting demand, even though monetary stimulus may not always be sufficient to close output gaps quickly and carries its own risks. in some economies, especially within the euro area, the transmission of monetary easing to the real economy is impaired. notwithstanding the risk of fuelling asset price bubbles or of policy encouraging excessive risk-taking, in most major oecd economies low underlying inflation rates give room for monetary policy action, and exceptional measures should remain in place for now and in some cases be pursued further.in the united states, the real economy appears to be responding to monetary easing, as household consumption has picked up and the housing sector has begun to rebound, despite fiscal headwinds. the forward guidance from the federal reserve, whereby policy rates will be kept low as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 per cent and projected inflation remains below 2½ per cent, appears well judged in current circumstances, providing assurance that monetary conditions will be supportive of demand while it is needed. as to quantitative easing, the point where the costs of further increasing the pace of asset purchases outweigh the benefits is likely to be within sight, but skilful judgement will be required to gauge the speed at which asset purchases can be phased out.in japan, the prospect of more aggressive monetary easing had already resulted in a 20% depreciation of the yen in real effective terms and a surge in equity prices even before the recent announcement from the bank of japan which specified details of the measures to be adopted in order to meet the new 2% inflation target. the boldness of the moves have boosted confidence and improved the chances of escaping from deflation and achieving more satisfactory output growth.further measures to repair the credit transmission mechanism are most needed in the euro area, especially in crisis countries where there are strong headwinds from private and public deleveraging and there is a need to reorient economies to export activities. rapid progress must be made to implement a comprehensive system of common banking supervision with clear crisis resolution and support mechanisms, as part of a process of returning banks to good health. the recent cypriot crisis, while an exceptional case, shows the importance of addressing banking crises directly and decisively, but also of putting in place the right institutions at the euro area level to maintain banking system stability.reforms to the global financial systemat their meeting in moscow in february g20 finance ministers and central bank governors recognised that long-term financing for investment is a key contributor to economic growth and job creation the oecd will prepare a report on “high-level principles of long-term investment financing by institutional investors” for the g20 leaders summit in september 2013.regarding financial reforms, progress has been made but perhaps not as fast and as coordinated as many may have hoped for. the pressure for reforms is weakening, and against a background of weak economies and fragile banking sectors, regulators have eased some of the planned reforms, in particular those concerning the liquidity rules. there are in fact many unfinished issues on the financial reform agenda, including harmonising accounting rules to enhance transparency; introducing a simple, binding leverage ratio in the basel rules; and finding ways to better limit contagion and address the too-big-to-fail problem by structural banking reforms, e.g. the separation and ring-fencing of banks’ activities.there are also recurrent discussions at the international level pertaining to the merits of introducing restrictions on capital flows, notably aimed at taming massive inflows of short-term capital and preventing a massive appreciation in the exchange rate of the domestic currency. these discussions are legitimate, but should not lead to uncoordinated and beggar-thy-neighbour policy actions. for more than fifty years, the oecd codes of liberalisation of capital movements and current invisible operations have provided a framework for promoting transparency and mutual accountability, sharing experiences with progressive liberalisation, and supporting countries at times of economic and financial disturbance. the codes can play a role when countries need to take measures to ensure financial stability, with a variety of provisions enabling countries to introduce restrictions on capital flows. at the same time, restrictions should not be used to substitute for exchange rate and other needed policy adjustments. moreover, it is important that restrictive measures are taken within an agreed framework of international dialogue and cooperation so as to avoid negative spillover effects and entering into a spiral of measures and countermeasures. the codes offer such a framework. since june 2012 they are open to adherence by all interested countries outside the oecd membership with equal rights as oecd countries. this is an important step in expanding international co-operation, maintaining deep liquid global capital markets, and making the most of international capital flows as a tool to finance growth and development. time has also come to think about how the codes should be improved to ensure we can continue to maximise the benefits from open capital markets while avoiding their downside effects.the economic and financial crisis continues to cast its long shadow on the labour market, with many countries facing high levels of unemployment and underemployment as well as rising long-term unemployment. youth, the low-skilled and immigrants have been hit the hardest, but no group has been spared. restarting the jobs machine remains therefore essential.the first response should be to restore confidence and growth, so as to stimulate job creation. however, it is also essential to ensure that effective support is provided to the unemployed and those at risk of falling into poverty and exclusion. governments should also undertake structural reforms aimed at strengthening formal sector job creation and improving job quality. the oecd welcomes the joint meeting of the g20 finance and labour ministers, which will be an opportunity to discuss mutually reinforcing actions on the macroeconomic, labour market and social policy fronts to support stronger, sustainable growth and better employment outcomes.even countries facing severe fiscal constraints can be smarter in designing labour market policies and targeting support to the individuals most in need using cost effective measures. for example, hiring subsidies should be targeted at helping the most disadvantaged groups — such as the long-term unemployed and out-of-work youth — back into jobs, while avoiding subsidising jobs that would have been created anyway. a number of countries have also demonstrated the value of work experience programmes for keeping these groups connected to the world of work, for example the jovenes programmes in several latin american countries. publicly subsidised training programmes can also play a useful role provided they are closely coordinated with employers to assure that training meets existing skill needs.structural labour market reforms also have a role to play. several european countries, notably greece, italy, portugal and spain, have embarked on ambitious labour market reforms recently. if fully implemented, they will encourage the creation of more and better quality jobs and improve the chances of many, including the youth and other new entrants to the labour market. but especially given the difficult labour market context, special attention should be given to supporting the most vulnerable groups in the transition. moreover, these reforms should be accompanied by competition-enhancing product market reforms in service sectors, such as retail trade and professional services. tax simplification and extensions of social insurance coverage are among the measures that can help to tackle high rates of informality in many emerging and developing economies.in some cases, structural factors that contributed to the crisis and led to growing external imbalances have yet to be fully addressed. meanwhile, the depth and duration of the crisis have resulted in higher overall and especially long-term unemployment, while policy responses to restore growth have saddled many advanced economies with heavy public debt burdens. in these circumstances, structural reform will have a large role to play in achieving stronger, more sustainable and fairer growth.many oecd countries have the potential to reduce costly distortions in the tax system and widen the tax base. in the euro area and japan, there is scope to reduce restrictive product market regulations that limit competition and hold back investment. regulatory and institutional barriers to labour market participation as well as labour market dualism should be reduced, while improving programmes to help the unemployed find work. some euro area countries need to use structural reforms to reduce relative unit labour costs to reverse earlier losses in competitiveness, allowing them to achieve both internal and external balance. in some cases, this process is well underway, which is welcome. structural reforms are generally less well advanced among euro area countries with current account surpluses, and more active reforms in these countries could help reconcile the need for rebalancing with a resumption of growth in the euro area as a whole.emerging market economies are also confronting many challenges, which vary across countries, but common themes include weak innovation, high barriers to competition, inefficient education or health systems, a high degree of informality in the labour market, and low-quality infrastructure. removing these bottlenecks would help to secure strong, sustainable and inclusive growth in these countries while also helping to reduce global imbalances.more must be done to facilitate trade and integration into global value chains. adopting a liberal trade and investment regime and a pro-competitive regulatory stance in key service sectors will be essential for countries, both advanced and emerging, to maximise the benefits from the internationalisation of services markets.substantial progress is being made on structural reform in some countries. notably, while growth in the euro area has continued to disappoint, the underlying rebalancing of the economy is well underway, even if it still has some way to go. structural reforms, notably in greece, ireland, italy, portugal and spain, provide a solid base for a recovery in competitiveness and an increase in employment when demand turns around. considerable progress has been made on reducing structural budget deficits, and in most euro area countries the largest part of the fiscal adjustment required after the crisis has already been undertaken. the short-term costs of these adjustments would be reduced by an improved supply of credit in debtor countries and structural reforms that help to rebalance activity and demand in surplus economies.

1224@OECD government borrowing set to rise slightly in 2013@http://www.oecd.org/finance/oecdgovernmentborrowingsettoriseslightlyin2013.htm@27/02/2013 - the gross borrowing needs of oecd governments are projected to increase slightly to around usd 10.9 trillion in 2013, up from the already high level of usd 10.8 trillion in 2012, according to a new oecd report.the oecd sovereign borrowing outlook 2013 expects that ratings agencies will continue to keep the pressure on governments in 2013. given their poor track record of sovereign risk pricing over the past twenty years, the report suggests that any downgrades should be carefully scrutinized, and not taken at face value.the general government deficit for the oecd area as a whole is estimated to have reached 5.5% of gdp in 2012, equivalent to around usd 2.6 trillion. it is projected to decrease to 4.6% of gdp in 2013, equivalent to around usd 2.3 trillion.government debt ratios for the oecd as a whole are expected to grow or remain at high levels during the coming year. general government debt-to-gdp is projected to reach 111.4% in 2013. the good news, according to the report, is that overall debt ratios are increasing much more slowly than in the past, declining from an increase of 11.5% in 2008-2009 to a projected 1.1% increase in 2013-2014.euro area-induced contagion effects in 2011 led to upward pressures on funding costs and roll-over risk for sovereigns, as well as a reduced ability by financial institutions’ to pledge sovereign securities as collateral and flight-to-safety by investors. however, the recently announced combined outright monetary transactions and european stability mechanism backstop has had a noticeable downward influence on bond yields in peripheral markets.in countries where public deficits and debt ratios have not begun to decline, the legacy of public debt exposes governments to shifts in confidence, complicating the implementation of issuance programmes by sovereigns. raising large volumes of funds at lowest cost to refinance their debt obligations will therefore remain a major challenge for many governments. most oecd debt managers will continue rebalancing their portfolios by issuing more long-term bonds and cutting back on issuance of short-term bills.many countries are expected to see a relatively high level of longer-term redemptions in 2013. for the oecd area as a whole, governments will need to refinance around 30% of outstanding long-term debt in the next three years. the oecd average long-term interest rate is expected to rise to around 4.0% in 2013, up from 3.8% in 2009.for more information, journalists should contact hans blommestein head of bond market and public debt management unit, tel.: +33-1-45247990 (fixed) or +33628710093 (mobile).

1226@Strengthening Euro Area banks@http://www.oecd.org/finance/strengtheningeuroareabanks.htm@big changes are needed to strengthen the capital positions of euro area bankseuropean banks remain at the heart of the euro area crisis. despite actions to strengthen banks and build a banking union, confidence in the euro area banking system remains weak, and is likely to remain so until underlying concerns over low capitalisation of some banks are addressed.low bank capitalisation persists in many countries despite an eu requirement that banks reach in 2012 a ratio of a minimum 9% of the best quality “core tier-1” capital to risk-weighted assets, in excess of the current international requirements.why has this new benchmark not been sufficient to boost confidence? in part, this is because it is based on risk-weighting of assets that likely understates risks, due to reliance on banks’ own internal risk models and, for example, the zero risk-weight given to sovereign debt. the ratio of core tier-1 capital to unweighted assets of euro area banks currently falls well short of 5% in many cases. this standard has been identified as a benchmark for well-capitalised banks in a recent oecd paper and it is more demanding than the minimum basel iii leverage ratio that will apply from 2018.increasing the capacity of european banks to absorb losses, by increasing their capital relative to assets needs to be addressed in the coming years. if the euro area’s largest banks were to move to a 5% standard, the current capital shortage is estimated at around eur 400bn (4¼ per cent of euro area gdp). this is not just a problem for banks in the “periphery” – there could be large capital needs in the major euro area countries. future capital needs could be lessened if banks were required to separate commercial banking and market activities, reducing the total assets of the banking business.moving towards a stronger banking system would help to rebuild confidence and get credit flowing again.the estimates are based on company reports and oecd calculations for around 200 euro area banks using a bottom-up approach that, first, assesses the additional capital required for each individual bank to reach a 5% leverage ratio and then adds up capital needs for currently under-capitalised banks based on this yardstick to obtain national and area-wide estimates of additional capital needs. the estimates are based on consolidated bank balance sheets, which are prepared on an ifrs basis and refer to information available as of september 2012. the estimated increase in bank capital to reach the 5% leverage ratio in greece is likely to decline substantially following the end-november decision of the eurogroup to disburse the efsf loan which includes 23.8 billion euros earmarked for bank recapitalisation. the estimates do not incorporate additional capital to cover potential future losses nor do they incorporate increases due to changes in the definition of core tier-1 capital under basel iii to be implemented by 2018.it should be underlined that a 5% leverage ratio does not currently form part of the internationally agreed basel iii framework, which expresses capital requirements in terms of risk-weighted assets and tier-1 rather than core tier-1 capital. a 3% leverage ratio based on total assets has been proposed in that framework as a backstop from 2018.

1228@Mobilising Investment in Low-Carbon, Climate Resilient Infrastructure - Environment Working Paper No. 46@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k8zm3gxxmnq-en@governments can encourage private investment in lcr infrastructure by improving the risk-return profile of projects. the paper provides a ranking of the most significant risks in financing lcr projects showing that policy (or sovereign) risks rank amongst the highest. the potential to finance lcr infrastructure in low income nations is challenging due to basic banking services, lack of non-bank financial services, weak risk management capacity and limited availability of long term funding. drawing on oecd?s work on the water sector, the paper reviews financing mechanisms that help to increase access to commercial banks, bond finance, project finance and equity finance in developing countries. green bonds are an example of a financing mechanism with strong potential for lcr infrastructure in developed countries, but supportive government policies are required. the paper concludes by considering governance arrangements that can enable and secure private engagement in lcr infrastructure investment, including public private partnerships (ppps). where governments have opted to use ppps, government ppp units may be suitable administrative units for managing delivery of lcr performance as an integral part of the infrastructure project.

1230@Efficient Public Sectors for Better Governance@http://www.oecd.org/finance/efficientpublicsectorsforbettergovernance.htm@opening remarks by angel gurría, secretary-general oecdparis, france21 november 2012(as prepared for delivery)good morning, ladies and gentlemen,welcome to the oecd and our first global forum on public governance. this forum is designed as a platform for dialogue between the oecd and partner countries. i am therefore delighted that 63 countries are represented today – an excellent start for what i am certain will become an important regular event.i am also pleased to see the chairs of three oecd committees (public governance, development assistance (dac) and regulatory policy), as well as participants of the “new consensus” on more effective institutions for development, signed in busan last year. this underlines our intention to make governance a horizontal topic across oecd committees and directorates.with such a wide range of participants and expertise, we can look forward to a day of rich discussions on building the quality institutions that we need.institutions matter (more and more)our countries are still going through a difficult period. this can be said for both our members and partner countries. many of our members are struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, while weak demand in the advanced economies is dampening growth around the world. in this challenging and unpredictable economic environment, institutions matter more than ever - for recovery, for growth, for well-being, for trust.too often, we look only at “what” needs to be done without paying enough attention to “how” to reform, or “whom” to involve.the lessons from the past crises underscore the need to look at broader national governance systems when we embark on institutional reforms. to ensure the effective functioning of governments and the equitable and efficient distribution of public resources we need: functioning parliaments, vigilant audit institutions, efficient courts and a vibrant civil society. this is why i am pleased to see so many representatives of these institutions in the audience today.the root causes of this crisis included serious weaknesses in governance and regulatory structures which often led to failures of judgment, implementation and coordination. as we take stock of these important lessons learnt, we need to help governments in strengthening their decision making processes upon which legitimate and decisive actions depend. the oecd has been promoting a broad range of initiatives to help governments advance in this direction. central to these efforts is the oecd’s new approaches to economic challenges initiative, which recognises that institutions and the political economy of reform need to be better reflected in the way we try to improve the working of market economies and reduce inequalities.the question is: how do we build an efficient public sector?it is not enough, however, to recognise the importance of good governance and to propose a theory of functioning institutions. rather, we need to take active steps to improve public policies and services in response to the increasing needs and demands from citizens and businesses.indeed, while oecd member and partner countries may differ significantly in their institutional frameworks, their concerns are very much alike when it comes to advancing public sector innovation, productivity and transparency. for example, innovations related to accountable institutions, performance budgeting, results-based management and open government are advancing at equal speed in both member and partner countries.the increasing use of collaborative on-line tools is a great example: in canada, the department of foreign affairs and international trade uses theses tools to include non-traditional actors in policy design; while in egypt, the ministry of state for administrative development uses an on-line platform to help citizens vote.we can also learn from each other; a prime example is the cooperation between the united kingdom and indonesia who are co-chairing the “open government partnership” on transparent, participatory and collaborative governments. we know that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution, that there are many different ways to strengthen institutions and to promote inclusive growth. but there are common threads and good practices in building smart states and effective institutions.let me highlight four key areas from our comparative work on governance in member and partner countries.1. building strategic state capacities to deal with policy challengesbuilding a strategic state is crucial in ensuring that governments are prepared to deal with socio-economic challenges. this requires the ability to set priorities, to align resources with priorities, and to implement policies. the oecd is undertaking public governance reviews in oecd and partner countries, such as colombia and kazakhstan, to develop the strategic state capacities. one lesson we learned from these reviews is the need for centres of government to develop a robust strategy setting and steering capacity as well as the authority to work effectively with different bodies of government.2. regulatory reforms to stimulate good governance innovations and promote place-based policiesthe oecd has developed regulatory reform principles and is undertaking reviews for better regulatory frameworks for inclusive growth. in september, i launched the indonesia regulatory reform review in jakarta. we suggested ways of streamlining policy-making processes and producing a transparent and comprehensive regulatory framework. this should increase market openness and ensure economic opportunity throughout a dispersed archipelago of over 17,000 islands. through our territorial development work we support a place-based approach to inclusive growth by looking not only at the most dynamic regions of a country but also helping to raise the development potential of less-developed regions.3. improving service deliveryaccessibility and quality of public services are essential for inclusive growth. the oecd observatory of public sector innovation supports governments in identifying innovative ways to deliver public services and reach out to communities. australia, for example, has launched the next step online community to better assist parents going back to work after years out of the workforce. innovative practices like this one can be useful for other countries looking to reform public service delivery.the next edition of our flagship publication “government at a glance” to be launched in october 2013 will provide international benchmarks for key aspects of service quality. this will help in improving public service delivery, particularly in such critical areas as health and education.4. promoting open, clean and responsive governmentsonly open and clean governments can gain public trust. through our cleangovbiz initiative, we provide a toolbox for diagnosing weaknesses and implementing better policies. together with the united states government, the oecd supports countries in joining the open government partnership, particularly in the mena region.ladies and gentlemen:citizens are losing trust and confidence in governments all over the world. according to the 2012 annual global trust barometer by edelman, people blamed their governments – more than any other institution – for the financial and political crises they endured in 2011. in most of the countries surveyed, government is now trusted by less than half to do what is right.[i] this is a very dangerous phenomenon. it is time to reverse these trends. it is time to win confidence back.this forum can make a big contribution. i am sure that your discussions will enrich our work and contribute to the oecd’s good practice framework on better governance for inclusive growth. this framework will offer a palette of policy options and good practices. it will help policy-makers deal with the urgent need of reinventing government, addressing governance deficits and finding innovative solutions to governance challenges. it can also serve as a critical reference for the development community in assessing governance and promoting governance reforms.but let us not forget the context of our work. in the end it boils down to making sure that governments deliver what they are paid for by their citizens: to design and deliver better policies for better lives.thank you very much.
1231@Towards green investment policy framework: The Case of Low-Carbon, Climate-Resilient Infrastructure - Environment Working Paper No. 48@http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k8zth7s6s6d-en@achieving low-carbon, climate-resilient (lcr) development is a policy goal of many governments today, and investment in built-infrastructure – in the energy, transport, water and building sectors – is a central part of the challenge. in the face of growing infrastructure needs and fiscal constraints, such transformational change will require large-scale private sector engagement. however, there is little policy experience on how to integrate climate and other environmental policy goals into investment policy frameworks and infrastructure planning. while many studies focus on the role of environmental and climate change policies to support a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient (lcr) economy, this paper suggests that other factors play a critical role to achieve this transition. it starts from the premise that climate change policies and their effectiveness cannot be studied in isolation, but need to be considered in a broader national policy context, one that has the enabling environment for investment and development at its centre. this report aims to advise governments on how to create and improve domestic enabling conditions to shift and scale-up private sector investments in green infrastructure, to finance a transition to a lcr economy and greener growth. this report advances a “green investment policy framework” taking infrastructure investment as a starting point and looking only at climate change mitigation and adaptation. it highlights the significant opportunities and many challenges that exist today in both developed and developing countries to transition to lcr development through investment in both renovated and in new infrastructure. the report suggests it is possible to generate multiple local development benefits from lcr infrastructure investment. it presents a five-point policy framework to guide domestic reforms that can steer use of limited public funds while also enabling and incentivising private investment to support a transition across relevant infrastructure sectors to simultaneously deliver climate change and local development goals.
1232@A Bank Divided Can Stand@http://www.oecd.org/finance/abankdividedcanstand.htm@"by angel gurría, secretary-general of the oecd. article published in the wall street journal, europe edition (see the original online version).financial regulators have written ever-more complicated rules to deal with increasing market complexity and to rectify past sins. unfortunately, the results are imperfect. in a way, they are bound to be. in a celebrated 1953 essay, milton friedman noted the impossibility of setting out theories that purport to meet all of the intricacies of finance and economics, arguing that a model is useful only if it can explain economic phenomena by isolating the ""common and crucial elements from the mass of complex and detailed circumstances.""from the outset of this financial crisis, the oecd has argued for clear and intelligible bank regulations. the ground has now begun to move in our direction. we believe it would be most effective to implement two complementary reforms.first, we need a simple leverage ratio—the amount of equity required for a given quantity of total assets—to control the problem of banks with too little capital. basel rules unfortunately gave banks ample scope to avoid such limits via so-called ""risk-weight optimization,"" with the result that banks are still short of the capital required to conduct business safely. this is especially true in europe, where €700 billion may be required to bring banks better into line.even some former members of the basel committee now appear to be changing their minds on the need for simpler rules. indeed, new research at the oecd and the bank of england suggests that the leverage ratio is far more effective than complex, risk-weighted capital ratios in influencing bank default risk.second, as we first proposed at the g-20 summit in 2009, the separation of commercial banking from large-scale proprietary securities businesses, notably in derivatives, is essential to avoid the cross-subsidization of excessive risk-taking linked to the too-big-to-fail phenomenon. we provided research to support this case to the u.k. independent commission on banking.separating retail and investment banking has been addressed through the volcker rule in the u.s. and the vickers reform in the u.k. separation is also on the agenda in france, where president françois hollande has expressed interest in the subject, and in germany, where there is growing support in some political circles. even sandy weill, citigroup's former chairman and one of the most influential players in the drive to remove america's glass-steagall act, suggested this summer that separation made sense. the new liikanen report also argues for the separation of proprietary trading of securities and derivatives related to market-making.the oecd's preferred model is legal separation and ringfencing in the corporate form of a nonoperating holding company. this prevents creditors of one troubled subsidiary from pursuing those of another, and facilitates the correct pricing of risk. the creation of more ""bite-sized"" affiliates also enhances the credibility of resolving them in the case of insolvency.if a crisis erupts in securities businesses, a separated traditional commercial bank could go on lending to households and firms. there would also be less deleveraging in the areas where local businesses depend on bank funding to deliver jobs growth.the securities business, meanwhile, would have to earn a proﬁt with clients aware that it would have less access to capital in the event of failure, and that failure would be unlikely to result in the socialization of losses. the risk premium associated with the securities business would appropriately rise, with more demand for properly segregated accounts and more rigorous collateral practices. the securities business would thus have to become less leveraged and more discerning when dealing with risky products. in other words, those who take the bets live with the consequences and pay for them.we need to be aware of potential impediments to progress. despite the evidence that complex capital rules are less effective than a simple leverage ratio, the latter is still only treated as a backstop rule under basel iii. the proposed level is 3%, implying 33 times leverage of capital—well below the median level of 5%, or 20 times leverage, recommended by the oecd.also, national approaches to bank separation are proceeding in a fragmented way while securities firms increasingly work without reference to national borders. with more european countries now interested in the issue of bank separation, we need more consistent approaches that deal with the issue in a simple and practical manner.complexity shouldn't lead to crisis. there is a better, simpler way: split the banks.• article based on the oecd report business models of banks, leverage and the distance-to-default• read more about sovereign debt and financial stability"

1235@Tax: Revenues rising slowly across the OECD@http://www.oecd.org/finance/taxrevenuesrisingslowlyacrosstheoecd.htm@24/10/2012 - in most oecd countries tax revenues are continuing to rise in relation to gdp from the 2008-09 declines seen at the beginning of the crisis, according to oecd’s annual revenue statistics. oecd countries collected about 34.0%[1]of gdp in taxes in 2011, compared with 33.8% in 2010. this is still well below the most recent peak of 2007 when tax revenues to gdp ratios averaged 35.1%.of the 29 countries for which 2011 data are available, tax revenues rose as a proportion of gdp in 20 and fell in only 6. this demonstrates a more pronounced trend toward higher tax revenues than in 2010, when there was a more even balance of increases and decreases across countries. chile, france, the czech republic and germany saw the largest increases in 2011, and hungary, estonia and sweden the largest falls. increasing tax ratios in 2010 and 2011 are due to a combination of factors. with a progressive tax regime, economic recovery led to tax revenues rising faster than gdp and at the same time many countries raised tax rates and/or broadened bases. in 2008 and 2009, the declining ratios reflected the severity of the recession and that some countries responded by cutting tax rates.“this increase in 2011 tax revenues supports fiscal consolidation efforts in many countries”, said oecd secretary-general angel gurría. “however, if oecd countries want to pursue these long-term strategies successfully, the increase in tax revenue must go hand in hand with efforts to restore long-term growth prospects, strengthen economic activity and create jobs.”revenue pressures have hit some levels of government harder than others, with the average tax ratio for local governments remaining steady since 2007 but declining for central, state and regional governments.european countries most affected by the financial crisis and subsequent recession - greece, ireland, portugal and spain – experienced an initial sharp fall in tax revenues in 2008 and 2009 and a small recovery in revenues since then.• chile (1.8 percentage points) and france (1.4 points) saw the largest tax ratio increases between 2010 and 2011. other european countries with significant rises were the czech republic (1.1), germany (1.0), finland (0.9), iceland (0.7) and the uk (0.7).• the largest fall was in hungary with a decline from 37.9% of gdp to 35.7%. two other countries - estonia and sweden - showed falls of one percentage point or more.• the increase in the us was in line with the oecd unweighted average, from 24.8% of gdp in 2010 to 25.1% in 2011.• compared with 2007 (pre-crisis) ratios, tax to gdp ratios in 2011 were still down by more than 3 percentage points in four countries – spain, greece, hungary and israel. the biggest fall has been in spain - from 37.3% of gdp in 2007 to 31.6% of gdp in 2011.• historically, tax-to-gdp ratios rose through the 1990s, to a peak oecd average of 35.2% in 2000. they fell back slightly between 2001 and 2004, but then rose again between 2005 and 2007 before falling back following the crisis.• denmark has the highest tax-to-gdp ratio among oecd countries (48.1% in 2011), followed by sweden (44.5%).• mexico (19.7% in 2011) and chile (21.4%) have the lowest tax-to-gdp ratios among oecd countries. they are by followed turkey at 25.0%, the united states which has the fourth lowest ratio in the oecd region at 25.1% and korea at 25.9%.• the tax burden in mexico increased from 17.7% to 19.7% between 2007 and 2011. four other countries - estonia, germany, luxembourg and turkey - showed increases of 1-2 percentage points over the same period.• 2010 data, the latest year for which a breakdown of revenues by category of tax is available for all oecd countries, show that revenues from corporate income taxes have steadied since the sharp falls of 2008 and 2009. however the share of these taxes in total revenues remains, at 9%, somewhat below its 11% share in 2007. on the other hand, the share of social security contributions has increased by 2% points to an average of 26.4% of total revenues.further information on revenue statistics, including key results, is available at www.oecd.org/tax/revenuestatistics2012edition.htm. this webpage includes an “information by country” section which describes separately the main trends for each oecd member country.for further information please contact oecd’s centre for tax policy, stephen matthews at + 331 45 24 93 22 or maurice nettley at +331 45 24 96 17>> see table a. total tax revenue as percentage of gdp.

1237@FINANCE: Solving Europe's banking and debt crisis@http://www.oecd.org/finance/financesolvingeuropesbankinganddebtcrisis.htm@02/02/2012 - the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by the underpricing of risk in financial markets, threatening the banking industry worldwide. the emergency measures to save the industry led directly to the sovereign debt crisis in europe, which in itself has exposed structural weaknesses in economic governance, jeopardizing the very existence of the euro region. any attempt to avert an eventual fracturing of the currency union will need a set of policies that go further than the proposals currently under discussion. a true solution will look like this:  the european central bank should continue to support economic growth and investor confidence via term funding for banks and putting a lid on sovereign bond rates in key countries via its operations, including quantitative easing, well into the future.  the “greece problem” needs to be resolved once and for all with a 50% (or larger) haircut on its sovereign debt and necessary ancillary policies, so that its chances of remaining in the euro improve. policymakers and political leaders should pursue a growth strategy with a balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and the gradual achievement of longer-run “fiscal compact” rules, combined with clear structural reforms including bank restructuring and recapitalization, labour and product market competition, and pension system reform. without a growth strategy, the banking crisis is likely to deepen and the sovereign debt problems will worsen.  the recapitalisation of banks needs to be based on a proper cleaning up of bank balance sheets and resolutions where necessary. this can only be achieved with transparent accounting.  european banks are not only poorly capitalised, but also mix investment banking with traditional retail and commercial banking. risk exposures in large, systemically important financial institutions (sifis) cannot be properly quantified let alone controlled. adrian blundell-wignall, special advisor to the oecd secretary general on financial markets and deputy director of the directorate for financial and enterprise affairs. these activities have to be separated. retail banks where depositor insurance applies should not cross-subsidise high-risk-taking businesses; and these traditional banking activities should also be relatively immune to sudden price shifts in global capital markets. traditional banks need to be well capitalised with a leverage ratio on un-weighted assets of at least 5%. these policies will improve, not diminish, the funding of domestic smes on which growth depends.  the ecb cannot lend directly to governments in primary markets and it cannot recapitalise banks: the role of the european financial stability facility and european stability mechanism may be critical in providing a “firewall” via these functions; and it also provides an exit strategy mechanism for ecb holdings of sovereign debt on its balance sheet. the size of resources the efsf/esm may need for all potential roles, particularly bank recapitalisation, should not be under-estimated. this is not independent of what the ecb does, but it could be around € 1trillion.  the current efsf/esm resources of € 500 billion are not enough. furthermore, the efsf has not found it easy to raise funds at low yields, even with guarantees. if the size is not enough, then the paid-in capital and leverage ability may need to be raised and brought forward – the € 500 billion limit could apply to the esm and not be consolidated with the € 440 billion resources of the efsf. but if these structures as envisaged cannot raise enough funds from private investors, as seems likely, other funding sources will need to be brought in. the only plausible mechanisms are: a bank license to the efsf and credit from the ecb (and increasing leverage); the international monetary fund is a “bank” and the ecb could lend to them the appropriate sums; sovereign wealth funds could be cajoled with appropriate guarantees (possibly via the imf) to provide the funds.  implementing these policies, along with a focus on growth and structural change, provide a chance for europe to solve its problems without fracturing the eurozone. but this remains a risk.  leaving the currency union permits countries to convert credit risk into inflation risk: monetisation of their debt and an exchange rate route to a growth strategy. still, the cost for europe as a whole of such an outcome would be large, and it is to be hoped that this can be avoided.• the above article, published 2 february 2012 in the bloomberg brief: economics europe, is a summary of new oecd research available at: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/14/25/49481502.pdf
1238@G20 Leaders Summit: Financial Regulation Session@http://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/g20leaderssummitfinancialregulationsession.htm@remarks by angel gurría, oecd secretary-general  cannes, 4th november 2011  (as prepared for delivery)   thank you mr. president.  yesterday, we discussed the current economic situation. countries are going through challenging times and are facing very different policy requirements. however, none of them can afford to disregard additional fiscal revenues. this increases the importance of tax initiatives in the g20.  the fight against tax havens is paying off. over the past two years, and despite initial scepticism, the veil of bank secrecy has been pierced. 700 agreements have been signed as of today. the global forum on tax transparency – put in place by the oecd in response to the g20 call at the london summit - is an instrument of irreversible change towards a more transparent tax environment that is now delivering 59 reviews. this initiative now counts 105 countries and constitutes the biggest and most effective peer review process in the world.  the oecd has estimated that almost 14 billion euros of tax revenues have been collected from over 100 000 wealthy tax payers in about 20 countries who decided that it was now too risky to keep their undeclared assets offshore. and we expect much more as the exchange agreements come into force.  but there is more to tax compliance than additional fiscal revenues. better tax compliance improve the fairness and effectiveness of our tax systems. we need to show our citizens that the tax burden is fairly shared and that those who use the 800 000 shell companies in the british virgin islands are being held to account.  president sarkozy’s leadership in this area shows what can be achieved when the g20 speaks with one voice. but we cannot be complacent in our fight against havens. the battle is not over. much more needs to be done. your signing, today, of the convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters, which is another relevant oecd initiative, shows that you are prepared to take the next steps and to move from bilateral to multilateral actions, and from exchange of information on request to automatic exchange.  this is also an important element of the g20 development agenda and the mobilization of domestic resources in developing countries.  i already talked about fairness in taxation. but fairness in the realm of consumer financial services is equally important. remember this is how the financial crisis started in 2007 with the subprime credits. you have achieved much progress in this agenda, and today you will endorse the principles on financial consumer protection that were developed by the oecd at the request of the french presidency. this is part and parcel of a comprehensive reform of the international financial architecture that should include financial inclusion, protection and education.  thank you.
1239@G20 finance ministers agree new principles to boost financial consumer protection@http://www.oecd.org/finance/g20financeministersagreenewprinciplestoboostfinancialconsumerprotection.htm@18/10/2011 - g20 finance ministers meeting in paris have agreed new principles on financial consumer protection developed by the oecd.  the principles form part of a broader initiative by g20 leaders to strengthen trust and confidence in the financial sector, which is widely recognised to have fallen since the economic crisis.  “without consumer trust and confidence we could jeopardise the basis for global economic recovery and growth,” said oecd secretary-general angel gurría at a conference in paris. “individual households have had to bear the brunt of the consequences of this financial crisis. it has been a catalyst for developing new rules of the game to address financial governance and risks.”  “financial consumer protection works best when accompanied by policies that promote access to affordable and appropriate financial products and services and through support for financial education and literacy interventions,” he said (read the full speech).  these three pillars – protection, access, and education – should be integrated in the broader regulatory framework, alongside prudential regulation, governance and competition policies, the oecd said.the principles were developed by the oecd at the request of g20 finance ministers in february 2011. they were developed in close co-operation with the financial stability board, other international bodies and standard setters, and involved consultations with groups including consumer and industry associations.  leaders will discuss the principles at the g20 cannes summit on 3 and 4 november 2011. “we believe that the g20 should continue putting an emphasis, not only on implementing the principles, but on forthcoming financial education issues,” said mr gurría.• more information on consumer protection is available at www.oecd.org/daf/fin/consumerprotection• more information on oecd work on g20 issues is available at www.oecd.org/g20for comment or further information, journalists should contact andré laboul, head of financial affairs division (tel.: +33 145 24 91 27) or michael chapman of the oecd’s financial affairs division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 79 43).
